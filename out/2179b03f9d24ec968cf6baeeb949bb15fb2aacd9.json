Here I consider this\nquestion in the context of my own fieldwork on the human rights response to children born of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. First, I\nreflect on how the academy functions to direct researchers\u2019 attention and skill sets to certain types of human rights problems in\ncertain ways, inevitably affecting what we can know about our subject matter. Second, I consider the practical politics by which\nhuman rights scholars interface with policy-makers, the media, and the public, and the extent to which members of the human\nrights scholarly community constitute nodes in the wider networks we are studying.\n\n\u201cThere is no view from nowhere, no secure, isolated academic\nrefuge, away from power, outside politics, economics, society\nand culture.\u201d\n\n\u2014Steve Smith1\n\nI\nn Spring of 2006, I was nearing the end of data collec-\ntion on my investigation into the human rights of chil-\ndren born of rape and exploitation in conflict zones,\n\nand I presented my preliminary findings on the topic at\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\u2019s Research in International Poli-\ntics (RIP) monthly brown-bag.2 In such circles, heavily\ndominated by empirical approaches, one does not present\nnormative theory (that is, value-laden arguments about\nhow the world should look) or policy-oriented sets of rec-\nommendations about particular problems. Rather, one\nidentifies empirical puzzles about the world and then goes\nabout solving them by applying or modifying existing theo-\n\nries. Theories, in this sense, are lenses said to explain and\npredict major patterns in world affairs.\n\nTherefore, I had organized this particular paper not as a\nproblem-focused human rights argument about children\nborn of war, but rather as an empirical study on \u201cissue\nnon-emergence\u201d within advocacy networks. I presented\nthe subject of \u201cchildren born of war\u201d as a negative case\nand demonstrated why, from the perspective of agenda-\nsetting theory, this might be considered an interesting puz-\nzle. The case, I argued, showed that we needed a different\nunderstanding of the obstacles to issue emergence. This\nwas the working paper version of a longer book project\nexploring why children born of war rape had received so\nlittle attention from advocacy organizations aiming to pro-\ntect war-affected children.\n\nMy colleagues provided a variety of suggestions on the\ntheory, the methods, and the structure of the argument.\nBut one piece of advice particularly sticks out in my mind.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better stop talking to international organizations\nabout this issue until you publish,\u201d said one senior faculty\nmember. \u201cOtherwise, before you know it, you will no\nlonger have a puzzle to explain, because these children will\nbe on the agenda.\u201d\n\nTwo things struck me about this comment. First was\nthe suggestion that in researching the non-emergence of\n\u201cchildren born of war,\u201d I might in fact be engaged in a\nform of issue entrepreneurship that could alter the research\nfindings. Second was the suggestion that the idea that\nmore attention to this population should have been less\npreferable to me (or anyone) than the ability to advance\nmy career by publishing an interesting paper.

Far from\nexisting outside their subject matter, human rights intel-\nlectuals are part of the human rights movement and actively\nshape it, whether or not our methodology demands it.\nBut my colleagues did not advise me to explicitly account\nfor this factor in my research or analyze the academy as a\nsource of momentum or resistance to new human rights\nissues. To turn the spotlight on the academy itself would\nhave been to breach professional norms within the disci-\npline, norms that tell us \u201creal\u201d research is distinct from\nadvocacy.3 I increasingly realized that this very dynamic\nitself required analysis.\n\nThe book that resulted from this research, Forgetting\nChildren Born of War, explored the absence of attention to\nchildren born of wartime rape on the human rights agenda\nin the 1990s. During the research and writing, I sought to\nexploit the recursive relationship between academics and\npractitioners methodologically. The research process for\nme consisted largely of poking around the human rights\nregime asking questions about what is not on the agenda\nand asking practitioners to justify their answers.4 This pro-\nvided insight into the regime itself, as well as its silences\nand the cultures within which different practitioners move.\nIt is a methodology I continue to use in my new project.\n\nBut such a method constitutes a notable, if modest,\nagenda-setting function in its own right. Simply raising a\nnew issue in a conversational setting \u201cmakes people think\u201d\nand stirs up dialogue. Communicative action can lead to\norganizational innovation. It also introduces the individ-\nual researcher to the network of gatekeepers who can stop\nan issue from emerging, as well as to those \u201ctrue believers\u201d\nwho might push for it.5 The practitioners may come to\nsee the researcher, through these discussions, as an expert\non the substantive topic. The researcher might be invited\nby true believers to consult or share findings with the\npractitioner community. If the researcher writes op-eds or\nuses blogs as a way to crowd-source ideas on his/her case-\nstudies, s/he may also inadvertently contribute to the ongo-\ning discussion s/he is simultaneously studying.\n\nThe choice of whether and how to exercise this role has\nimplications both for the research and for the organiza-\ntions under study, and eventually for the population of\nconcern. It is therefore impossible and irresponsible to\npretend that the research process itself has not influenced\nthe very communities of practice we study. Acknowledg-\ning this required me to reflect on my own role in the\nhuman rights network, and that of like-minded colleagues\n\nand academia as a whole, as I completed the manuscript\nfor my former book and my new one. For no scholarly\nwork\u2014least of all one that plays at the boundary between\npolitik and wissenschaft\u2014can be fully understood without\nan honest interrogation of the author\u2019s relationship to her\nsubject matter, mediated through the institutions in which\nshe is embedded.\n\nThis argument is not original.6 Critical theorists have\nlong asserted that it is intellectually dishonest to avoid\naccounting for one\u2019s role in the social construction of world\nevents.7 Yet while calls for greater reflexivity in the disci-\npline are now commonplace, they are rarely implemented\nin mainstream IR research.8 Even rarer are empirical stud-\nies of the IR discipline as a site in which global politics\ngets constructed. This is because taking seriously the idea\nthat we are part of the world we are studying requires\nmore than a few paragraphs in our methods section. It\nrequires a willingness to turn the analytical lens uncom-\nfortably inward.\n\nThere are examples of this. James Rosenau offers such a\nsituated approach to studying IR in the final chapter to\nhis 2003 book Distant Proximities, detailing his intellec-\ntual journey throughout the sociology of IR as a discipline.\nPatrick Jackson and Stuart Kaufman also provide an account\nof their interactions, as scholars, with the political debate\nover the US occupation of Iraq.9 Armed with the encour-\nagementof suchwriters, Iwrote afinal chapter formyhuman\nrights book documenting the academy\u2019s role, including my\nown, in and around the issue I had been studying.\n\nBut when I submitted the manuscript, peer reviewers\ntold me it was unsuitably autobiographical for a scholarly\ntext, and the editors at Columbia University Press insisted\nit be cut. With the tenure clock ticking I reluctantly\nagreed\u2014but came away from that experience even more\ncertain that the practical politics of knowledge construc-\ntion in the academy was an important part of the answer\nto my own research question.\n\nHere I try again to provide that missing account of the\nintellectual genealogy of my book Forgetting Children Born\nof War, its evolution bumping up against the contours of\nthe human rights regime on the one hand, and the acad-\nemy on the other, as a lens into these wider dynamics of\nissue creation in the human rights movement. I reflect on\nthe many ways that institutions of higher learning also\nserve as both entrepreneurs and gatekeepers, governing\nwhat does or does not get on the global agenda\u2014and how\nscholars think about and navigate their own inevitable\nrole in that process.\n\nI proceed in two sections, each embellished with first-\nperson examples from my fieldwork in the human rights\nmovement and my location in the profession of IR. The\nfirst section examines how the academy functions to direct\nresearchers\u2019 attention and skill sets to certain types of human\nrights problems and not others.

First, it illumi-\nnates for students and interested readers the everyday pol-\nitics behind scientific inquiry. Second, it provides an honest\nsupplement to the drier characterization of my method-\nological choices in the formal book version of this project,\nhighlighting the gap between what we actually do and\nhow we are taught to characterize it in scholarly writing.\nThird, it illustrates the ways in which the academy is also\na site of human rights agenda-setting and agenda-vetting\u2014a\nmissing causal influence in my study on the subject.\n\nArticulating a Research Question\nThe choice of human rights subject matter is one of the\nfirst moments in which human rights intellectuals exercise\npower over the global human rights agenda. Shall the topic\nof study be the determinants of torture? The effectiveness\nof torture? Whether a certain practice constitutes torture?\nThese decisions are shaped by a variety of factors, includ-\ning the availability of existing research or data on which to\nbuild, the availability of funding, the disciplinary norms\nin which the researcher is situated, the researcher\u2019s relative\nrank in the academic hierarchy (younger scholars are under\nmore pressure to publish within the \u201cmainstream\u201d) and\nsuch mundane factors as whether the researcher is rela-\ntively mobile. Some of these factors work against one\nanother. Younger scholars are likelier to be itinerant and\nadventurous, but they also face the greatest professional\ndisincentives to study unorthodox topics.10\n\nA second important question is how to frame a partic-\nular topic. In the IR field, a very heavy emphasis rests on\nempirical scholarship that explains something new about\nthe world.11 Students are seldom trained in or encouraged\nto think about normative theory; there are few positions\navailable in political science for researchers who study or\nteach applied ethics. Students interested in philosophy or\n\u201cpolitical theory\u201d might study ethics, but IR remains largely\nan explanatory discipline.12\n\nWhen I first began to dabble in the subject of \u201cwar\nbabies\u201d during my first year of doctoral work in political\nscience in 1998, I immediately ran up against this discon-\nnect between the ostensible purpose of my research\u2014to\nexpose the failure of the human rights community to\nrespond to some very vulnerable individuals\u2014and the dis-\nciplinary norms about the nature and raison d\u2019\u00eatre of aca-\ndemic research. My mentor and great friend Ronald\nMitchell impressed upon me the importance of beginning\nnot with a \u201cshould\u201d question but with a \u201cwhy\u201d question\nthat could lead to an explanation of some empirical puzzle\nabout the world.\n\nThis emphasis on explanatory rather than normative\nresearch is a wider phenomenon in the discipline, and\ntherefore no advisor does his or her student a service by\nallowing him or her to write too far outside of this main-\nstream.13 I myself socialize my students in this way. What\nthis means, however, is that human rights \u201cscholarship\u201d\npublished in good IR outlets is often very far removed\nfrom the kinds of questions that activists are asking them-\nselves and indeed from the very questions that motivate\nmany young scholars to pursue political science before\nthey are properly socialized, professionalized, and disci-\nplined by our \u201cexpert\u201d training.\n\nConsider Beth Simmons\u2019 recent book on human rights\ntreaties. Simmons does not question whether human rights\ntreaties are adequate or whether there is something dys-\nfunctional about the human rights regime, since it has\ncontributed only to marginal improvements in human\nsecurity over the course of the last seventy years.14 Rather,\nshe is interested in exploring what accounts for the observ-\nable variation within those margins. This is something\nthat can be studied using previously compiled datasets\nand regression analysis. Similarly, while Joel Oestreich\u2019s\nbook Power and Principle includes a bold chapter explic-\nitly theorizing ethical questions about rights program-\nming in international organizations, it comes at the end\nand includes a rather lengthy justification of this diver-\ngence from the mainstream subject matter.15\n\nI am not saying that purely explanatory work is invalid.\nQuite the contrary. As Paul Krugman argues in a quote\nthat hung on Ron Mitchell\u2019s door during my years at\nUniversity of Oregon, an important line must be drawn\nbetween serious scientific study, in which the scholar\u2019s mind\ncan conceivably be changed by the evidence, and sheer\nadvocacy.16 Robert Keohane makes a similar point in his\nimportant essay \u201cPolitical Science as a Vocation\u201d: \u201cIn our\nparticular investigations we need to seek objectivity . . .\nbecause otherwise people with other preferences . . . will\nhave no reason to take our findings seriously.\u201d17 I too drill\nthis into my students\u2019 heads at every opportunity.\n\nBut what I am saying, and what I take pains to impress\nupon my students, is that the \u201ccult of explanation\u201d also\ncauses scholars to miss much of importance in the world.\nIt not only inures us to \u201cshould\u201d questions but causes us\nto miss certain \u201cwhy\u201d questions, of which \u201cwhy not\u201d ques-\ntions are an important subset. The methods commonly\nused for explanatory work tend to lead scholars toward\ndatasets that exist, to events that have happened, and to\nissues that are politically salient already. These practices\ndirect our attention away from \u201cdogs that don\u2019t bark\u201d and\nraise the barriers to gathering new data.18 They cause us to\noccupy ourselves with topics we think might be of most\ninterest to policy-makers, rather than taking the margin-\nalized as our frame of reference.\n\nAs critical theorists have long claimed, disciplinary norms\nsuch as these affect the nature and type of research we do.\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 365\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. Australian National University, on 22 Jul 2021 at 03:24:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\n\n\nMy early career can easily be used as a case in point. Pre-\nsenting to my classmates and mentors an early draft of an\narticle on \u201cchildren born of war\u201d that was later published\nin Human Rights Quarterly, I quickly recognized on the\nbasis of the feedback that this was not a dissertation-\nworthy topic. While I did publish the piece at the encour-\nagement of another mentor, it was made clear to me that\nthis article, and the journal in which it was published,\nwould not be of particular help to me in my early career as\na political scientist. Since I was interested in a variety of\nother topics as well, it was easy to abandon this project for\nthe four years it took me to finish doctoral work.\n\nFunders also heavily impact the type of work that is\ndone in the social scientific study of human rights, and\nhow this work is framed. Returning to this topic after I\ncompleted my Ph.D. resulted largely from the availability\nof funding, namely a MacArthur Foundation Research\nand Writing grant that allowed me to conduct exploratory\nfield research in Bosnia and in human rights hubs. Judg-\ning from the reviews from MacArthur as well as later pan-\nelists associated with the National Science Foundation,\nfunders are much readier to invest in \u201csexy\u201d but unexplored\ntopics than are dissertation chairs or scholarly journals.\n\nBut funders also have a set of guidelines regarding how\nmoney may be used that impacts how research may be\nframed and carried out, and thus shapes the practice of\nhuman rights knowledge construction in the academy.\nOne example is the unwillingness of funders to associate\nthemselves too directly with sensitive subject matter. The\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) is particularly con-\ncerned about this, as it is beholden to taxpayers and reli-\nant on Congressional appropriations for its ongoing\ninvestment in the natural and social sciences. So although\nthe NSF was pleased to fund my proposal entitled \u201cMass\nRape, Forced Pregnancy and Children\u2019s Human Rights\u201d\nin the summer of 2004, the Program Officer insisted that\nthe title be changed before the project was entered into\ntheir database. It would not do, I was told, for the project\nto attract too much attention from certain constituencies,\nnor did the NSF have an interest in its projects sounding\nhyperbolic or \u201cpolitical.\u201d Although by this time mass rape,\nforced pregnancy and children\u2019s human rights were simply\ndescriptive terms of reference already defined in inter-\nnational discourse, to the Program Officer they sounded\n\u201cunscientific.\u201d19 This anecdote shows how disconnected\nthe language of science can be from real human beings\nand their struggles. This disconnect has consequences. But\nthat abstraction is also absolutely necessary: it protects the\nscientific community and the idea of research for its own\nsake from the kind of politicization that can undermine\nthe scientific enterprise.20\n\nObtaining Human Subjects Clearance\nMy research on sexual violence and child rights was con-\ntingent on interactions with other human beings who\n\nhad more insight and expertise than myself into these\nsensitive subjects. Before a researcher affiliated with a\nmajor university may undertake any research involving\nother human beings, s/he must go through a heavily\nbureaucratic process called a Human Subjects Review.\nThe process is mandated by the federal government under\nrules established by the Department of Health and Human\nServices and the Food and Drug Administration to gov-\nern medical testing on humans. In US institutions, it is\nnow impossible to conduct research involving any sort of\nhuman interaction until the researcher undergoes ethics\ntraining and obtains institutional approval. One is barred\nprofessionally from using interviews even for a project in\nwhich clearance was eventually obtained, if the inter-\nviews occurred before the university signed on the dotted\nline.\n\nThe Institutional Review Board (IRB) process, while\nimportant, itself is daunting and can sometimes pose an\nimpediment to research. If a researcher fails to dot an i or\ncross a t the processing of necessary forms can be held up\nfor weeks, and grant money can be lost. Work in foreign\ncountries can be even more complicated, sometimes requir-\ning formal permission from the government involved\u2014a\ndifficult hurdle if the research project is designed to doc-\nument human rights abuses against vulnerable populations.\n\nEarly in my career, I welcomed the human subjects\nprocess as an opportunity to educate myself, prepare pro-\nfessionally and receive oversight from specialists in how to\nmanage ethical dilemmas in my work\u2014something else\nfor which there was no required course in my social stud-\nies graduate education. Over time, however, I clued in:\nthe process is largely designed not to protect human sub-\njects, but to protect universities from malpractice suits.\nBecause human subjects clearance is based on addressing\nthe types of dilemmas faced by medical practitioners, nei-\nther the training nor the oversight is of much relevance to\nscholars conducting interviews among traumatized or vio-\nlently divided populations in post-conflict societies. Nor\ndoes the IRB concern itself too much with these kinds of\nquestions.\n\nNothing better illustrates this than my decision to inter-\nview a certain minor child in the former Yugoslavia. This\nwas a decision of considerable gravity for me. I had decided\nearly on not to include interviews with children. I knew\nthere would be problems gaining access to an appropriate\nsample and I was concerned about stirring up contention\nwithin their families and communities. I preferred to leave\nprimary data-gathering on children themselves to others\nwho were trained in social work or had the resources to\nmaintain an ongoing presence in the children\u2019s lives. So\nthis limited my methodology to those involved in the\nhuman rights regime around the children.\n\nI reconsidered this general decision when I realized that\nthis particular boy had explicitly become such an actor\nwhen he publicly launched a documentary about his life.\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nReflections | Constructing Human Rights in the Academy\n\n366 Perspectives on Politics\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This\nyoung man had identified himself as a child of war, and\nsignaled a capacity and willingness to tell his own stories.\nI felt it only ethical to include him in my respondent\npool\u2014not as a war child but as an activist for children\nborn of war. Since my original application for human\nsubjects clearance had specified only adults in the respon-\ndent pool, I had to submit a \u201crevised protocol\u201d in order to\nsecure permission to interview a minor child.\n\nI contacted my source at the IRB office before submit-\nting the revisions to make certain I had all my t\u2019s crossed.\nBut to my surprise, he seemed nonchalant about the revi-\nsions. He seemed to interpret his job as not to ensure that\nI conducted myself ethically, but rather to streamline the\nprocess for me in any way possible. He asked, \u201cIs this the\nonly child you\u2019ll be interviewing?\u201d Yes, I said. \u201cWill you\nbe testing any hypotheses?\u201d No. \u201cWill you be generalizing\nfrom the interview?\u201d Hardly. \u201cIn that case,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t need permission. You\u2019re not really doing scientific\nresearch, so it doesn\u2019t really come under our jurisdiction.\u201d\nOne child\u2019s well-being as a research subject was too insig-\nnificant for the IRB office at University of Pittsburgh or\nthe US federal government to be concerned with.\n\nNever mind the fact that I would very much have liked\nto have had my hands tied! New to research in violently\ndivided societies, untrained in ethnographic methods, with\nno background in social work or child psychology, I felt\nrather unprepared for the work of befriending and inter-\nviewing a war-affected family. Of course, I was grateful to\nhave the go-ahead, since I very much wanted to corrobo-\nrate information I\u2019d already gathered from other sources.\nBut when issues did arise with this family, I had little\nsupport from my university in sorting out how to balance\nmy professional identity with what I felt was a growing\nweb of personal friendships.21\n\nThe process of human subjects clearance should, in\nprinciple, be the scholarly community\u2019s version of what\ninternational organizations call \u201crights-based program-\nming,\u201d which as Joel Oestreich writes, involves \u201cthinking\nabout whether policies are morally defensible and whether\nthey help individual people.\u201d22 The institution of human\nsubjects clearance certainly constitutes the former: it is a\nset of rules, procedures, and ethical standards that aim to\nprotect the dignity and rights of individuals who contrib-\nute to research studies. One might imagine, therefore,\nthat the IRB process would invoke the latter as well, that it\nwould be a site for an ongoing consideration of the rela-\ntionship between human rights and the scholarly enter-\nprise and how the latter could be brought to bear on\nimproving the former. It is thus an irony that the human\nsubjects process itself can pose such barriers to rights-\nbased research on international human rights violations.\n\nThe Data-Gathering Process\nFraming a research topic and securing permissions affects\nthe nature of science, and many have argued that this\nprocess is affected by academic norms, bureaucratic rules\nand the political economy of funding. But the selection\nand implementation of a methodology for pursuing the\nstudy further delimits the nature of the research enter-\nprise, the types of questions that can be asked, and the\nfindings that will emerge, and to a large extent dictates\nthe type of written output that will result. And as with the\nquestion formulation stage, the academy privileges certain\nmethodologies over others.\n\nThis has implications. If the subject of research is human\nrights, the choice of method as well as question affects\nwhat can be said about human rights. For example, my\ndecision to never interview children as such shaped what I\ncould and could not say about children born of war; my\ndecision to expand my methodology beyond interviewing\nto participant-observation affected not only my conclu-\nsions but also the ways in which I later interpreted my\ninterview data. Both decisions also affected my cach\u00e9 with\nhuman rights practitioners, sometimes negatively and some-\ntimes positively.\n\nIn the IR subfield specifically, there are many debates\nabout what constitutes an appropriate methodology for\nwhat question, and scholars are under normative, strate-\ngic, and practical pressures to carefully consider and jus-\ntify their methodological choices. Post-positivist scholars\nhave often lamented the weight attached to getting it\n\u201cright.\u201d23 I experienced an example of what they are talk-\ning about when I described this project idea to a senior\nfaculty member at a job interview near the beginning of\nthe research, when I was thinking of the book primarily as\nnormative theory. He asked me: so what is the research\nquestion, and my answer at the time\u2014to document how\nthe babies were faring\u2014tallied poorly with the language\nand raison d\u2019\u00eatre of IR as a discipline.\n\nOver time the project evolved in a direction that better\nfit the theoretical concerns of my subfield: it became less\nabout the babies per se and more about what their absence\nfrom the human rights agenda meant for the study of\ninternational regimes. This was not only a result of vari-\nous subtle career pressures, but also the path-dependency\nof Western academia\u2019s emphasis on specialization. My orig-\ninal project would have required a set of methodological\ntools in which I was ill-trained. The latter enabled me to\nengage the methods of elite interviewing with which polit-\nical scientists are slightly more familiar and in which I had\nsome experience.\n\nInterview research involves establishing a conversa-\ntional context with another human being. From this, one\nderives a transcript that may be plied for substantive facts\nor studied as a narrative artifact. A complication is that\naspects of one\u2019s social-professional identity and status them-\nselves affect the interview process, whether or not by choice,\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 367\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

As\nCarol Cohn has written of her ethnographic work in the\nnational security establishment: \u201cThere was an \u2018I\u2019 who\nasked the questions, and inevitably, who I am shaped not\nonly what I noticed and was able to hear, but also what\npeople would say to me and in front of me.\u201d24\n\nMy various identities\u2014American, political scientist, pro-\nfessor, woman, mother\u2014were interpreted differently in\ndifferent research contexts and always affected the data I\nwas able to gather. In many cases this worked to my advan-\ntage. As a woman (and a woman interested in children),\nfor example, I may have seemed less intimidating to male\npolicy-makers; being a woman with some expertise in\ngender-based-violence issues simultaneously helped me\nwhen I interviewed women\u2019s organizations.\n\nBut these very same attributes may have induced some\ntrepidation by diplomats associated with the Holy See\nwho I interviewed about their role in blocking reproduc-\ntive health legislation in multilateral settings. (In those\ncases, I stressed my status as a mother and interest in\nfamily issues and children\u2019s rights.) Elsewhere, I was repeat-\nedly reminded of my outsider status\u2014as an American in\nBosnia-Herzegovina and as a non-practitioner when I\nentered the professional spaces of the UN system. This\nstatus enabled me to \u201cplay na\u00efve\u201d in such a way as to gain\ninformation that might not have been articulated as such\nto insiders, but it also limited what people would tell me\nopenly. And to the extent that I was na\u00efve\u2014that is, never\nas fluent in the subtle norms and jargon of each commu-\nnity of practice through which I drifted as were my\ninformants\u2014there are certainly many things I missed or\nmisread. To compensate for this, I asked those informants\nwith whom I was able to maintain a correspondence to\nreview drafts of my work as it emerged, a practice I con-\ntinue on my new project.25\n\nIn any case, my personal attributes surely colored what\nwas shared with me and how, as well as how I interpreted\nit. Interviewing is never objective and interview data never\nentirely accurate. This became clear to me in part because\nI had been hoping that the opposite would be the case\u2014I\nwent looking for information on war babies not from the\nchildren or families themselves but from gatekeepers in\ncivil society surrounding them. As it became more and\nmore obvious to me that second-hand stories of war babies\ncould not be relied upon to provide credible details about\nspecific cases, my agenda shifted to identifying broad pat-\nterns and more importantly, narratives about what rights\nviolations against war babies meant to those with whom I\nspoke. Thus, the choice and limitations of my methodol-\nogy ended up reconstituting my research questions.\n\nBesides these kinds of normative, tactical, and social\ninfluences, the research process may also be affected by\nmore pedestrian matters. Grant funding influences aca-\ndemics, research processes, and scientific outputs, by gov-\nerning the types of expenses that may be written into a\n\nbudget. For example, there are limits to what may be con-\nsidered an appropriate payment to a research subject for\nthe time it takes to contribute to a study and the cap is\ninvariably lower than what populations in conflict zones\nfeel their time and stories are worth. Similarly, dependent\ncare expenses are not typically considered reimbursable\nresearch expenses by funders, so young parents conduct-\ning fieldwork in the academic profession must choose\nbetween covering the costs of their minors to accompany\nthem in the field, or leaving them at home.26 In my case,\nI opted for many short trips to the field rather than long\nperiods away from my children.27\n\nBeyond questions about the validity of a methodolog-\nical approach, a different set of concerns drives ethical\ncritiques of research methods in IR. Among qualitative\nresearchers, feminist IR scholars and those cynical about\nthe overly-positivist leanings of political science more gen-\nerally, a strong norm toward participatory research has\nemerged.28 A central tenet of this approach is that research\nparticipants themselves should be provided some degree\nof control over the research process. As Julie Mertus wrote\nin her endorsement of participatory research for future\nstudies of children born of war, \u201cby having the research\nprocess conducted . . . with significant input from local\nactors, the potential for participating individuals to be\nempowered in defining their role is greater.\u201d29 On bal-\nance, humanitarian practitioners agree with Mertus; our\nfocus groups found that any consideration of a global study\ncarried out by international agencies was conditioned on\nthe assumption that beneficiary populations should be\nempowered to assist in designing, conducting, interpret-\ning, and disseminating the research.30\n\nI found, however, that such a research strategy is com-\nplicated by work on topics like children born of war.\nChildren are the population of concern, but it may be\ninappropriate to require their close involvement in research\ndesign. Nor can \u201cthe local community\u201d\u2014generally mean-\ning adult gatekeepers\u2014be uncritically empowered when\nthe goal is to tease out the experience of marginalized\ngroups. My research subjects generally were adults, but\nmy research topic was children. I could hardly have allowed\nthese adults to design and interpret my results while\nremaining true to the goals of the study. In his conclud-\ning chapter to Born of War, a separate volume of essays I\nedited on the human rights of war babies, Michael\nGoodhart articulated this dilemma clearly: \u201cParticipatory\nresearch . . . presumes a model in which clear, objective\ndistinctions exist between members of the oppressing and\noppressed groups . . . in cases involving children born of\nwar, where oppression of children and mothers stems\nfrom oppression of the wider group to which the moth-\ners belong, this felicitous alignment of values and inter-\nests breaks down.\u201d31\n\nIn addition, I found that research participants often do\nnot wish to be burdened with analysis of data or questions\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nReflections | Constructing Human Rights in the Academy\n\n368 Perspectives on Politics\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Though I offered all informants an opportunity\nto review drafts or hold veto power over how their words\nwere to be used, very few availed themselves of these oppor-\ntunities. In the end, I was satisfied that my research infor-\nmants from the organizations that articulated the clearest\nchild-rights approach seemed comfortable with my meth-\nods. As a psychotherapist from one woman\u2019s organization\ntold me, \u201cI am happy that your research methodology is\nthoughtful and careful and you\u2019re not harassing these vic-\ntims for their stories.\u201d32 My constant second-guessing of\nmy methods, however, was strong evidence to me of where\ndisciplinary norms about research in conflict zones are\naligned, and I wonder how these may impact researchers\u2019\nwillingness to tackle complex subjects for which these\nnorms were not designed.\n\nBesides participatory research, a current norm among\nresearchers of violently divided societies is to \u201cgive some-\nthing back\u201d to those being studied.33 And for good rea-\nson: a participant in one of my focus groups said, \u201cPeople\noften say to me . . . that they feel extremely exploited by\nthe research community. Yes, they came out, they saw us,\nand they never talked to us again. Yes, they came out, they\nput their names on whatever they wrote, and we don\u2019t\nknow anything about it.\u201d So researchers who take seri-\nously the humanity of their subjects will avoid \u201cparachut-\ning in\u201d on conflict zones and then disappearing, and will\nrather aim for a more meaningful and politically active\nengagement with those individuals whose time they share\nthrough the research process.34\n\nIn this too, I discovered that ethically appropriate field-\nwork was not quite as cut-and-dried as book chapters in\nmethodology volumes might suggest. In some cases, it was\neasy to negotiate ways that I and my research could give\nback.The most clear-cut case was Medica Zenica, who asked\nsimply for me to send copies of my writing when it was done,\nto read draft grant applications, and to share contacts I might\nhave with donors as needed. But sometimes it was compli-\ncated. The film director who produced the documentary\nwhose politics I analyzed offered me an interview on the\ncondition that I would write a review of his new film for\npublicity purposes. Although I was not told it had to be a\npositive review, the implication was obvious, as was my pres-\nence as a human agent within my own subject matter.\n\nI chose to accept. I wanted the interview, and I felt\nconfident I could write an honest review.35 However, the\nincident started me thinking about how political the pro-\ncess of \u201cgiving back\u201d can be. There is nothing uncompli-\ncated in providing endorsements for one party or another\u2019s\nconstruction of a social problem, particularly when a debate\nis afoot within a community. My rule of thumb on this\nproject was that I would never do or say anything in\nexchange for information that I did not genuinely believe\nserved the cause of promoting children\u2019s human rights as I\nunderstood them.\n\nFinally, there is a fine line between \u201cgiving back\u201d to the\ncommunity one studies and becoming part of that com-\nmunity in a way that causes a rethinking of one\u2019s method-\nology. When I was invited by UNICEF twice to consult\non the development of a fact-finding study, and invited to\nadvise the War and Children Identity Project (WCIP) in\ntheir efforts, I faced choices between continuing to observe\nand collect narratives versus actively participating in and\nshaping those narratives.\n\nI chose to reconstitute my project as action research. It\nseemed unethical to me to study a human rights non-\nissue without contributing to well-intentioned efforts to\nturn it into an issue. I decided my insights into the com-\nplexity and pitfalls could be of help to issue entrepre-\nneurs at UNICEF and WCIP. But this hardly represented\na sacrifice of my research project to normative concerns.\nRather, I realized that there was no better way to study\nthe barriers to issue construction than to participate in\nefforts at issue construction and document the resistance\nencountered.\n\nPublishing in the Academy\nWhen they heard I was writing a book, my respondents in\nBosnia-Herzegovina usually assumed that I had already\nsecured a publisher and had been awarded a large advance\nto conduct research. As academics quickly learn, scholarly\nwriting is not done for money and is rarely considered for\npublication until it is complete. And successfully publish-\ning an academic book on human rights often requires\naltering the message to fit the perceived market, the con-\nceptual and normative orientations of the reviewers, and\nthe editor\u2019s vision of how the book should \u201cfit\u201d with oth-\ners in the house\u2019s series.36\n\nThe process of publishing an academic book manu-\nscript begins with a short proposal to a publishing house\nin the discipline. If an editor is interested, the manuscript\ngoes out to a number of reviewers selected for their exper-\ntise in the area, or often on the basis of their willingness to\nread the manuscript.37 The author does not know the\nreviewers\u2019 identities; and the reviewers attempt to provide\nfeedback on the manuscript solely on their assessment of\nits suitability for the press and its scholarly merit. The\ntype of factors reviewers consider in determining this \u201cfit\u201d\ncan play a strong role in shaping the social construction of\nscientific \u201cknowledge.\u201d38\n\nFeminist scholars, for example, have long emphasized\nthe way in which gendered assumptions about \u201caccept-\nable\u201d types of knowledge and \u201cappropriate\u201d research meth-\nods have mitigated against studying the gender dimensions\nof world politics, or, more generally, those on the \u201cbottom\nrungs.\u201d In a landmark study on social norms, Martha\nFinnemore and Kathryn Sikkink cite the paucity of gen-\nder scholarship for 50 years in the flagship journal of the\nIR discipline, International Organization, as an example of\n\u201cnorms\u201d at work: \u201cWe suggest that there may have been a\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 369\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

If a manuscript is\nperceived by an editor as a \u201cgender\u201d manuscript, it will\ninvariably be sent near-exclusively to IR feminists for review\nbecause of the assumption that feminists are the \u201cexperts\u201d\nwhen it comes to gender work, even though feminists\nhave long encouraged mainstream IR scholars to also\ndevelop gender expertise. This gives establishment femi-\nnist scholars a tremendous amount of influence over the\nway that younger scholars, feminist or non-feminist, can\nwrite or think about topics perceived as being relevant to\n\u201cgender studies\u201d in IR. Studies that do not fit the mold are\noften rejected.40\n\nThough I developed this book as a child rights project\nrather than a work of gender theory, when I began send-\ning out parts of the project for review, I discovered that\neditors would assume that a study concerning wartime\nrape is a subject best reviewed by feminist scholars. And\nfeminist gate-keepers were not uniformly enthusiastic about\nthe work, because it did not take as its starting point the\nperspective of women. So gate-keeping practices within\nthe academy, as well as within the human rights network\nmore broadly, pose obstacles to reframing human rights in\nnew or unexpected ways.\n\nThere is also a more general prohibitionary norm in\nacademia of identifying oneself too clearly as a real-world\nperson rather than as a professional writing objectively\nabout some subject matter. One bumps into these norms\nwhen writing up professional biographies to accompany\nscholarly books or articles. A detailed genealogy of my\ndissertation work, drafted as a preface to the book version,\nwas cut down by the editor, who insisted in particular that\nI not admit the book had previously been a dissertation.\nThe editor of a respected IR journal insisted I excise a\nreference to my role as a mother from my professional bio\nbefore an article of mine appeared in the journal. And\nalthough I argued with him over this, I found myself mak-\ning similar demands on the contributors to my edited\nvolume as we prepared the manuscript for submission.41\n\nHow much do these practices cause IR scholars to dis-\nassociate ourselves from the worlds we are studying? How\nmuch does this color an accurate interpretation by our\nreaders of our interrelationship with the subjects of which\nwe write? How much does it contribute to a false distinc-\ntion between the sheltered world of Western academia\nand the world \u201cout there\u201d we writers, teachers and think-\ners help to construct through our painting of it? How\nmuch do they convince us to \u201cstudy\u201d human rights viola-\ntions without taking responsibility for building a world in\nwhich they are lessened?\n\nWhen I was in the early stages of field research, one of\nthe key questions asked by friends I developed in Bosnia-\n\nHerzegovina was who would publish my book. Another\nwas will it be translated into Bosnian? I was at a very na\u00efve\nand idealistic stage of my professional development, and\nmy initial reaction was to think I\u2019ll insist on a publisher\nwho will translate it. As the tenure clock ticked, however, I\nfound myself worrying much more about whether the\npress that published the book would be considered \u201cgood\nenough\u201d by my tenure committee.\n\nI had learned through trial and error as a junior scholar\nthat the hierarchy among academic publishing houses\nweighs heavily on one\u2019s tenure prospects and market value\nin the discipline. A number of colleagues have said to\nme that my one professional \u201cmisstep\u201d was not criticism\nof the feminist canon (nor blogging while untenured,\nnor showing up at an International Studies Association\npanel dressed as a Cylon), but rather publishing my\nfirst book with a commercial press. In 1999, Larry Good-\nson, Bradford Dillman, and Anil Hira conducted a sur-\nvey of political scientists\u2019 understandings of the press\nrankings in the discipline. They found that \u201cmajor uni-\nversity presses enjoy the highest level of prestige and great-\nest familiarity.\u201d42\n\nSome commercial presses bridge the gap between schol-\nars and practitioners adroitly, but this is not an attribute\nthat is rewarded in the academy. Such publishers seek\npolicy-relevant work that is academically informed but\npractical, and pitched in a jargon-free style so as to be\nunderstandable by those working in policy rather than in\nthe classroom. My decision to publish the volume of essays\nBorn of War with Kumarian instead of a university press\nlay partly out of a sense of duty to get the research in the\nhands of practitioners.\n\nBut one\u2019s career advancement in political science hinges\non publishing with university presses, as I was gently but\nfirmly reminded by some (not all) senior faculty at Uni-\nversity of Pittsburgh in the aftermath of signing the\nKumarian contract. And publishing a book in a top uni-\nversity press (particularly if you are a junior scholar) gen-\nerally means making it relevant to other social scientists,\nnot to policy makers.43 The editor at Kumarian liked the\nedited book idea and immediately began thinking of how\nto sell it to the humanitarian sector. By contrast, editors I\nspoke with at university presses were concerned with which\ntheoretical debates my manuscript was speaking to and\nin which kinds of political science classes it might be\nassigned. Publishing in the academy requires making one\u2019s\nwork relevant to professional political scientists and their\nstudents, not to the policy community, not to everyday\npeople who might be interested in understanding an issue\nbetter, and certainly not to those being researched. In\nshort, the pressure to talk and think and write about\nhuman rights in particular ways poses subtle pressures on\nacademics. This contributes, I think, to scholars\u2019 ten-\ndency to focus on certain topics\u2014data-rich, well-\ntheorized, suitably abstract\u2014and not on others.44\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nReflections | Constructing Human Rights in the Academy\n\n370 Perspectives on Politics\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

I have argued that the acad-\nemy contributes to human rights agenda-setting in ways\nthat ought to be acknowledged if we care about why\nsome human rights get attention and others do not. In\nthis section, I want to shift gears and talk about the ways\nthat scholars interface intentionally with the practitioner\nworld as scholars in the service of normative goals. This\nis also important for two reasons. First, we need to do it\nbetter. But second, we also need to think about what\nwe\u2019re doing and be prepared to do it responsibly, for this\nis an enterprise fraught with trade-offs. It is also one that\nruns the risk of feeding back into and affecting research\nitself.\n\nHanging Out on the Theory-Policy \u201cDivide\u201d\nMuch is made of the theory-policy gap, and I think it is\nfair to say that the academy institutionalizes barriers to\npolicy-relevant research in multiple ways. It privileges\nvalue-neutrality, whereas policymakers want prescrip-\ntion.45 It incentivizes careful, lengthy, esoteric analysis,\nwhile policymakers need concise, jargon-free, actionable\nproposals.46 Academics work up to several years on each\npaper; policymakers need short briefs produced on much\nshorter timelines and they care less about scientific rigor\nthan about the nature of the specific issue at hand.47 As\nChristopher Hill has said, \u201cThe more scholars train for\npolicy relevance, even if only to justify our existence to\nsociety at large, the more difficult it becomes to maintain\nintellectual integrity.\u201d48 This has led some IR scholars to\nargue that \u201cwhat is needed is a conscious effort to alter\nthe prevailing norms of the academic IR discipline.\u201d49\n\nI\u2019m not so sure. In Spring 2008, I gave a job talk at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts-Amherst. Because my audi-\nence was a department of political scientists, I gave the\nscholarly version of my talk, based on the theoretical papers\nI had recently published in the journals International Stud-\nies Quarterly and International Organization. As I had done\nat my own university, I spoke of advocacy networks, issue\nemergence, negative cases, hypothesis-testing and gener-\nalizability. I made cursory mention of the topic of chil-\ndren born of war, and framed the issue as an interesting\npuzzle rather than a dreadful human rights problem. After\nan array of comments from the audience about my meth-\nods and conclusions, one senior member of the audience\nraised his hand and said, \u201cThe subjects you are raising are\nvery disturbing. You talk about these terrible things so\nmatter-of-factly, in this language of science. I think you\nhave some great armor built up around you to help you\ndo this. But I want to ask you what you actually think\nabout it. What should be done?\u201d\n\nAt first, I was taken aback by the question. Later I\nrealized it was one of the richest I had received in years of\ngiving that presentation at universities and conferences. I\nanswered, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to seem morally agnostic about\nthe problems of these children. But I\u2019ve tailored this talk\nto a scientific audience. Perhaps you\u2019d like to see the other\nversion of my talk, the briefing I give to humanitarian\nworkers, to UNICEF, and to conferences on children and\narmed conflict.\u201d\n\nI meant don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not merely cold and rational\nabout these things\u2014only when I perceive that it suits the\ncontext. We wear different masks in different settings. But\nwhat I myself realized as a result of answering his question\nis that while it\u2019s sometimes hard to speak the languages of\nscience and policy simultaneously, it\u2019s neither impossible\nnor, as my colleague at Pitt had feared, undesirable; and\ncertainly it\u2019s possible for the same researcher to alternate\nbetween pitching the same argument in different ways for\ndifferent audiences.\n\nAnd the entrenched academic norms do in fact leave\neven junior scholars some room to maneuver. I have\nencountered practitioners willing to listen to me as an\nacademic, and academics hungry for me to articulate a\nclear policy stance. Joseph Lepgold has written, \u201cThere is\na wider range of IR groups than the theorist-practitioner\ndichotomy implies, and the infrastructure that supports\ntheir activities has created a framework for useful exchanges\n. . . more such interactions take place already than is com-\nmonly acknowledged.\u201d50 Indeed, I have found on this\nproject that the gap between theory and policy, between\nacademics and practitioners, is as much one of habit as of\nnecessity. And habits can, and should be broken when\nunhelpful\u2014or, at least, reconsidered and renegotiated.\n\nIt\u2019s all a question of learning the right skills. Unfortu-\nnately, these skills are seldom taught in political science\ngraduate programs. I was lucky to land my first teaching\njob in a professional school of international affairs, where\nmy students would go on to work for the intelligence\ncommunity or State Department, rather than to become\nresearchers. Teaching in a professional school helped me\ndevelop the skills needed to translate insights from social\nscience into meaningful prescriptions for policy-makers.\nThese are indeed different audiences speaking different\nlanguages, but the barrier is not insurmountable\u2014as Alex-\nander George puts it, it is \u201cmore of a chasm than a gap.\u201d51\n\nIndeed, as some colleagues and I discussed at a recent ISA\nroundtable, University of Massachusetts-Amherst\u2019s IR pro-\ngram is striving to incorporate bridge building between\nthe theory and policy worlds actively into our doctoral\ncurriculum.\n\nBut experiments of this type make clear that bridging\nthis chasm is not without its consequences for the way\nacademics think about research, interpret the results, and\nmake sense of our responsibilities as political creatures.\nWhat skill sets do we need to cultivate, and to pass to our\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 371\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

I began to envision a version of my research findings\nthat was not about building IR theory at all, but about\nprotecting children born of war, that would speak of the\ngap in programming and advocacy not as a critic or a\ntheorist, but as a helpful observer with some concrete\nsuggestions.\n\nWho would publish such a piece? Not conventional IR\njournals.52 Even if they did, who would read it? Other\nscholars perhaps, their students if I were lucky, but not\nlikely these busy professionals in policy and planning\ndepartments of humanitarian agencies. To create a slick\nversion of the argument, I realized I would need funds to\nself-publish. Though it hadn\u2019t occurred to me to put such\na line item in the original budget, the NSF permits research-\ners to request up to 20 percent of the amount of their\ngrant as a \u201csupplement\u201d to carry research further, and one\nof the permissible expenditures is \u201cother direct expendi-\ntures related to publication, documentation and dissemi-\nnation.\u201d53 I was able to secure matching funds from the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\u2019s Graduate School of Public and\nInternational Affairs (GSPIA), which was only too happy\nto put its logo on a sleek policy report authored by one of\nits junior scholars, as well as both cash and in-kind assis-\ntance from the Ford Institute of Human Security, a research\ninstitute at GSPIA.\n\nSelf-publishing on a sensitive, politically salient topic\nnecessitates a number of important and intensely political\ndecisions by the researcher. For example, what policy rec-\nommendations could my team conceivably put forth? The\nfocus groups on which we were reporting in the docu-\nment essentially showed a lack of consensus among prac-\ntitioners as to how to proceed, as well as a lack of serious\nprior consideration of the problem. In such a venue, what\ncould researchers without field experience credibly sug-\n\ngest? Plus, by taking explicit policy positions, would we\nnot cross the line from research to advocacy, complicating\nour role as objective experts?\n\nIn the end, we limited ourselves to describing the state\nof knowledge and practice in the humanitarian sector, and\narguing simply for some policy attention to the children,\nwithout concrete proposals.54 We provided basic informa-\ntion on children born of war, using illustrative case studies\nrather than broad generalizations, and to the extent pos-\nsible, allowed the practitioners\u2019 comments to speak for\nthemselves. We concluded that serious fact-finding was\nthe appropriate next step to generate a set of policy options\nfrom which humanitarian planners could choose.55\n\nEthical dilemmas also arose. Since reports of this nature\nrely on imagery as much as analysis for their impact, they\nconstitute an exercise both in scholarship and marketing.\nThe cover photo represented the most difficult problem.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\u2019s graphic designer proposed a vari-\nety of evocative images. Most included a crying child in a\nwar-torn land, a tearful female refugee, or a mass of women\nand children in a camp. I disliked all of them. I wanted\nsomething haunting, but non-descript; something uplift-\ning. I wanted a picture of a child playing, not weeping. Or\nperhaps a child watching other children play. I wanted\nanonymity, a blurry image: no actual child\u2019s identity should\nbe used for this report, I insisted.\n\nBack and forth I went with the Marketing Office. In\nthe end we settled on a photo of a child looking out a\ndoor, most of his face hidden. It could have been a child\nanywhere; these were in fact orphans in Sri Lanka and not\nchildren born of war at all. It was the closest I could come\nto evoking the kind of thoughtfulness I hoped the report\nwould engender without the absurd, voyeuristic, pitying\nsensationalism I saw in much media coverage of war chil-\ndren. I wanted the report to make humanitarians go, hmm,\nwithout cringing: here is a population who is hiding in\nplain sight. I had learned from the focus groups what a\ndelicate task that could be. It was the limit of my role as a\nresearcher, but that I owed it to my research subjects to do\nthat much.56\n\nAnother strategy I used for engaging with the human\nrights and human security community as a scholar during\nthe life of this project was through political weblogs. I was\ninspired to blog toward the end of this project, in the fall\nof 2007, largely due to encouragement from other politi-\ncal bloggers in the profession.57 Of course, until very\nrecently, blogging had been rather a suspect activity for\npolitical scientists, especially those not yet tenured. A some-\nwhat alarming article entitled \u201cBloggers Need Not Apply\u201d\nwas published pseudononymously in the Chronicle of Higher\nEducation in 2005, outlining the potential risks to a scholar\u2019s\nprofessional reputation of spouting off political views in\ncyberspace.58 These alleged risks, coupled with the grow-\ning trend toward maintaining weblogs, particularly among\njunior scholars, has led to a number of commentaries on\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nReflections | Constructing Human Rights in the Academy\n\n372 Perspectives on Politics\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

(Or, at least, so they said\nopenly, and I believed them.) In fact, I had been invited to\ncontribute to Security Sweep, a blog established by the\nRidgway Center for Security Studies at GSPIA. So I felt\nless pressure than some junior faculty, and at any rate,\nconfined my activities (at first) to a group blog (Duck of\nMinerva) with minimal time or content commitments.60\n\nThe bigger dilemma for me was not some perceived\ntrade-off between teaching, writing publishable articles,\ndoing committee work, and blogging. Rather, I worried\nabout the political impact that my blog posts might have\nand the way that I was affecting my subject matter by\nwriting about my work still in progress. In a sense, it was\njust another way to disseminate my understanding of chil-\ndren born of war to a wider audience\u2014not just the human\nrights community per se, but human rights-minded lib-\neral policy elites in Washington who periodically read the\nruminations of the Duck of Minerva bloggers. But as before,\nI reconciled my dual role by allowing the grim facts to\nspeak for themselves. I did not openly advocate for global\nattention to children born of war in these venues, but\nrather simply suggested that the lack of it was a very inter-\nesting puzzle.61 The same is true on my new project fol-\nlowing other low-profile campaigns; I am likelier to write\nanalytically about the campaigns or the issues themselves\nthan to make the case for any particular policy solution.\n\nFinally, I disseminated my findings directly to policy\npractitioners when I presented briefings to the human\nrights and humanitarian community. On several occa-\nsions I was invited to brief members of this community:\nat the UNICEF Innocenti Center in Florence, Italy; at\nUNICEF\u2019s Child Protection Division in New York; at\nthe Experts\u2019 Meeting in Cologne, Germany; and at the\nUnited Nations Office of the Special Representative to\nthe Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.\nOne can think of such moments as data-points in a time-\nline of gradual issue emergence. The solicitation of such\nbriefings by practitioners suggests an emerging acknowl-\nedgement of a problem and interest in solving it. It also\nprovides opportunities to collect data on the current spaces\nfor articulating new human rights, and on the bound-\naries of those spaces, the points at, and ways in which,\npolicymakers listen, and the reasons for which they push\nback.\n\nBut such briefings are undeniably also moments of polit-\nical engagement.\n\nThe role of the responsible scholar, surely, is to avail\noneself of every possible opportunity to communicate one\u2019s\nfindings to those with the power to change the world with\nthem.62 Yet to maintain the objectivity on which the\nauthority of experts is based, the researcher must be seen as\nobjective, not political. This poses no conundrum, in fact,\nto the extent that the researcher\u2019s project is about the prob-\nlem. The objective research process applies when studying\nthe problem; a position is taken when presenting the\nfindings.\n\nBut what about when the research project is actually\nabout the reaction of the policymakers, as in this case?\nThough I was usually brought in to brief practitioners\nabout the children born of war, this was always a limited\nportion of my project. My underlying interest was the\nreaction of the international community. And if the point\nof the research project is to document the failure of the\ninternational community to react, then efforts to provoke\nsuch a reaction to some extent would appear to muddy\nthe distinction between researcher and researched.\n\nTo the extent that I solved this problem at all, I did so\nat first by limiting my incursions into the policy arena. I\nprovided the information asked\u2014usually about children\nborn of war themselves, not the absence of a policy\nresponse; I let these facts speak for themselves, and then\nobserved the reactions of the audience. In situations where\nI was invited to participate as well as present, I erred on\nthe side of observation. Of course this was harder in focus\ngroups or conversational settings where it must have been\nobvious what I was fishing for. In those cases, I learned\nmuch by genuinely listening and trying to understand\nwhy practitioners might not see the child rights issues as\nclearly as I felt I did. In the end, that is what a researcher\ncan do: keep an open mind.\n\nHandling the Media\nA second mechanism for disseminating one\u2019s research find-\nings beyond academia can be, if your topic is timely and\nsexy enough, the media. Seeking (or acquiescing to) media\nattention can only be described as a fraught and precari-\nous enterprise. When writing policy reports, blogging or\ndoing briefings, the researcher\u2019s audience is the non-\nscholarly community, but the researcher always maintains\ncontrol over the message.\n\nThis is not true at all when you agree to allow the\nmedia to \u201ccover\u201d your scholarly pursuits. National papers\nare on the lookout for research on new, interesting, or\ngalvanizing issues that resonate with readers. Local papers\nwant to report on what local intellectuals are studying and\nhow they are connecting to the world beyond the munici-\npality. Universities want to publicize the research activities\nof their faculty. All these players seem to assume that a\nfaculty member has a stake in \u201cgetting the news out\u201d and\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 373\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

None of these players has\na stake in nuance or in timing the release of stories in such\na way as to calm, rather than enhance, the jitters of prac-\ntitioners working to come to a consensus about a new\npolicy problem. And they often underestimate the way\nthe wrong sort of news coverage can kill the careful delib-\neration that is often percolating behind the scenes on dif-\nficult or sensitive issues.\n\nFor these reasons, I avoided media attention for my work\nas long as possible. When I released my stakeholder report\nto the humanitarian community, for example, my hope had\nbeen that this would be disseminated widely amongst them-\nselves.But Ihadhoped the storyof the reportwouldbemuted\nin the media, because I suspected it would be taken less seri-\nously by humanitarian organizations if the media blew it\nout of proportion or framed it carelessly. When I returned\nfrom the briefing at UNICEF at which I distributed the\nreport and presented the findings, I found that a casual\nremark to my Dean about the urgency of printing copies in\ntime had turned into a major university news story about\n\u201cPitt Professor Going to the United Nations.\u201d\n\nAfter a few experiences like this, with reporters calling\nme up, dropping by my office for sound-bytes on the \u201cwar\nbabies\u201d work, and sometimes taking my remarks out of\ncontext, I developed a set of guidelines for myself in inter-\nfacing with the media. If the source was print media, I\ndemanded one of two options: 1) the right to edit the\ndraft story, which was rarely allowed; or 2) to answer ques-\ntions in writing instead of orally, so as to choose the word-\ning carefully. If I were to do a radio interview, I insisted on\nhaving the questions in advance\u2014though, I learned, on a\nlive show this is no guarantee that one won\u2019t be thrown\ncurve balls. Though many of my colleagues told me it\u2019s\nmuch better to go on live than pre-taped \u201cbecause you can\nspeak truth to power and they can\u2019t edit you out,\u201d I dis-\ncovered that pre-taped shows gave me more flexibility to\nshape the content. If I knew that only the best sound-\nbytes would be used, I could simply refuse to answer cer-\ntain questions or provide awkward, incoherent answers to\nthose where I changed my mind half-way through.\n\nSuch are the strategies by which a scholar can maintain\nsome control over the uses to which his/her work is put in\nthe popular consciousness. In each case, though print and\nradio journalists inevitably wanted me to speak to unan-\nswerables such as \u201chow many of these babies are there\u201d or\nto prognosticate about whether \u201cmore orphanages for these\nchildren would help,\u201d my story remained simply the lack\nof programmatic attention to the children. I did not see it\nas my role to make specific policy recommendations as\nmuch as to draw attention to vulnerabilities, expose pro-\ngrammatic gaps, and articulate complexity.\n\nConsulting\nOf course, nothing blurs the line between research and\nadvocacy more greatly than becoming a consultant on a\n\npolicy project in the policy domain whose work one is\nstudying. So it is surprising, given the phobia academics\nare said to feel toward integrating too obviously with the\nworld of practice, that so many take consulting positions.\nIn choosing to involve myself as a consultant on projects\nthat I was following, I functioned not only as an observer\nbut also as a direct player in agenda-setting efforts regard-\ning children born of war. The extent to which I was able\nto contribute in a rights-oriented way to the development\nof this discourse was very much a product of the banal,\neveryday dilemmas associated with developing and over-\nseeing a research project and drafting written results.\n\nMy foray into consulting with UNICEF began as an\naccident. As a result of the \u201cpoking around\u201d by myself and\nearlier researchers, the Sarajevo UNICEF field office became\ninterested in the possibility that UNICEF was missing a\ncategory of vulnerable children. But the Program Officer\nneeded to delegate the task of data-gathering to someone,\nand an academic \u201cexpert\u201d from whom the organization\ncould distance itself if the project turned out to be a fail-\nure was a logical choice.63 It was a win-win situation for\nme because I would have access to any data gathered by\nUNICEF. Moreover, as I explicitly outlined in the mem-\norandum of understanding I negotiated, I could use my\ninsights on the project to better understand the relation-\nship between UNICEF and the issue construction pro-\ncess.64 The following year, when UNICEF\u2019s Innocenti\nCentre picked up on the Bosnia draft study and began\nhatching ideas for a follow-up study in New York, I was\nagain asked to write a background document that would\nset the stage for an initial meeting in New York to launch\nsuch a study. Now committed to an action research\napproach, I again agreed.\n\nIt seems like a simple and an obvious thing to be will-\ning to do as an outside expert: assist policymakers in devel-\noping a framework for beginning to address a problem.\nBut I found it difficult to maintain a specific identity as an\nindependent, objective researcher\u2014an \u201coutside expert\u201d\u2014\nonce accepted as a player within a policy domain.65\n\nWhereas I had previously been observing UNICEF as it\nfunctioned in post-war Bosnia and beyond, suddenly I\nwas inside the game in a way I had been able to pretend I\nwasn\u2019t when I was \u201csimply doing interviews.\u201d\n\nThis shift to a more participatory methodology caused\nme some mental discomfort, as the lines blurred between\nmyself as a researcher and as a practitioner. My field notes\nbecame much more reflective and the process of interpret-\ning data more complex. I had to take stock of how my\ndual role was affecting the subject I was researching, how\nto make sense of that methodologically and even how to\nreconcile conflicting roles. I minimized this tension as\nbest I could by maintaining a distinction in my mind, and\nwith UNICEF, between my own independent book project\nand my work as their agent.

It sets out ways of sharing data between\nthe two projects and clarified which data would be cited as\nUNICEF\u2019s rather than my own.66\n\nYet this distinction was more an artifact of our mutual\nunderstanding (and the norms of my profession) than a\nreality, and I found it was subject to reinterpretation by\nUNICEF officials to suit the needs of the moment.67 My\nformer translator had originally been hired to assist with\nmy independent interviews. When I recruited her to get\ninvolved with the UNICEF fact-finding study as well, I\nnaively assumed she would compartmentalize the two\nprojects as I did. But an exit interview later made it clear\nthat she had never really disassociated the UNICEF project\nfrom my broader book project, and saw both of them as\ninter-related. In fact, I got the sense that she saw the dis-\ntinction as nonsense, and from a perspective outside West-\nern academia, perhaps she was right.\n\nThere was also an interesting politics in consulting, a\npolitics regarding the social construction of knowledge.\nFor one thing, standard scholarly norms governing research\nmethods, ownership over data, and vetting of results were\nout the window.68 One of the key points of tension between\nmyself as a supposed \u201cindependent expert\u201d and the orga-\nnization for whom I was producing written outputs, was\nthe purpose of research and expectations about research\ndesign. In discussions over the scope of the Bosnia study,\nfor example, UNICEF officials stressed that the kinds of\nconclusions we could reach on the basis of the interviews\nhad to be related to the types of programmatic services\nUNICEF was willing to offer.69\n\nBy contrast, I naively viewed the project as drawing on\nthe knowledge of civil society actors who had some under-\nstanding of the families\u2019 actual needs, in order to deter-\nmine a policy direction. I asked whether it wouldn\u2019t be\nmore appropriate to determine vulnerabilities first, then\ndecide what programs to develop. But the response was\nthat UNICEF had only certain capabilities, and it couldn\u2019t\npublish a report defining vulnerabilities in a way that it\nhad no capability to meet. Since a different program offi-\ncer had taken over by the time the draft was ready, I wrote\nup an exhaustive list of proposals from the survey none-\ntheless, partly to test what UNICEF as an organization\nmight be willing to leave in the document, and how much\nof \u201cUNICEF\u2019s\u201d perspective was really one individual\u2019s per-\nspective. My report included such suggestions from civil\nsociety actors as \u201cdirect payments to families.\u201d Sure enough,\nthe incoming program officer insisted, as his predecessor\nwould have, that these types of recommendations be\nstricken from the report.\n\nIn the end, I aimed to provide as objective and inde-\npendent a perspective as possible, while deferring to the\norganization when it pushed back. I was willing to omit\n\nthings from written outputs that I felt needed to be said,\nbut I drew the line at writing things I genuinely disagreed\nwith.70 I therefore played some role in constructing\nUNICEF\u2019s understanding of these issues, but also \u201cwent\nalong with the gatekeepers\u201d when it came to certain frames\nand arguments. In this sense, it\u2019s not entirely clear to me\nwhether I played a genuine role as an issue entrepreneur\nthrough my consulting work, or was essentially co-opted\nby human rights gatekeepers.71 Or, for that matter, how\nmuch of my uncompromising commitments as an out-\nsider actually impeded UNICEF\u2019s ability to find an advo-\ncacy frame that suited its organizational ethos. I may never\nknow.\n\nEpistemological Trade-offs\nIt is, in fact, nearly impossible for a researcher to assess\nthese kinds of impacts on him or herself because of his/\nher own subjectivity. Nonetheless we can at least reflect\nupon these matters. Thus, we come full circle to the trade-\noff which my colleague highlighted in the anecdote that I\nbegan with. Robert Keohane argued at the International\nStudies Association Conference in 2008 that IR scholars\nhave a responsibility to ask questions and do research \u201cthat\nmight conceivably matter in the real world.\u201d72 To exercise\nthat responsibility we must engage with the real world.\nBut by doing so, we become part of the processes we wish\nto study as objective outsiders. By embedding oneself in\none\u2019s subject matter\u2014by disseminating outputs to policy-\nmakers, writing for venues practitioners will read, speak-\ning to the media or consulting\u2014to what extent does the\nIR theorist abdicate any claims to objectivity, replicability,\nand methodological rigor?\n\nThese are important questions. But I came to acknowl-\nedge that, depending on the particular project, researchers\nare never so separate from the world we are studying as\nsome of us would like to think. The responsibility lies in\nacknowledging this interrelationship and how it affects\nthe research, rather than pretending it away, and interfac-\ning with the policy sector in a way that is morally consis-\ntent with the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the project: in my case, in a\nway that itself is rights-oriented.\n\nIn the end, I chose to participate in efforts at issue\nconstruction as well as to observe, in order to document\nthe barriers encountered. The access to the human rights\ncommunity this engendered assisted, rather than compro-\nmised, my project methodologically. But it did also alter\nit. People are likelier to talk openly once they get to know\nyou as a person. A conversation over drinks after a briefing\nis much different than a formal, professional research inter-\nview. But \u201cinformants\u201d/colleagues are also likelier to antici-\npate your questions, to be cognizant of what you\u2019re fishing\nfor and how you may interpret their statements. They\nlearn to frame their message to fit what they understand\nof your normative and causal orientation to the subject\nmatter.73 And the research becomes a two-way street, almost\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 375\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The\nproject became more interpretive, as the insights I gath-\nered were based not on an analysis of text transcripts of\nmultiple standard interviews, but rather based on an ongo-\ning series of interactions\u2014sometimes correspondence,\nsometimes snippets of conversation over lunch, some-\ntimes snatches of speech overheard in a women\u2019s bath-\nroom in the United Nations, sometimes off-the-record\nremarks.\n\nIn this sense my own thoughts, impressions, and roles\nin these conversations became very much part of the data-\nset. The practical issues faced when marketing research\nfindings to the humanitarian sector taught me about the\nnature of issue construction in that sector, about framing,\nabout ethics, about social networks, and about what sorts\nof language to adopt and what to avoid. These insights\nreflected and helped me understand much of what I\u2019d\nbeen told in my interviews. The process of dealing with\nthe media as an \u201cexpert\u201d supplemented my content analy-\nsis and historical research on the role of the media in\ndrawing attention to issues. These experiences increased\nmy understanding of what both journalists had told me\nand what human rights advocates had told me about jour-\nnalists, even as my own remarks and commentary then\nbecame part of the text-data-set I was studying. Consult-\ning provided me practical knowledge of the institutional\nnorms within UNICEF and the humanitarian sector\nbroadly. Such context-based knowledge gained through\neveryday practice is very different from what one can derive\nfrom an interview. It was valuable, even though it required\nme to theorize my own influence on the communities I\nwas studying.\n\nSo I concluded that interfacing with the policy com-\nmunity in order to disseminate research findings itself\nconstitutes a form of participant observation that can\nsupplement and enrich earlier research findings derived\nfrom multiple other methods. And participant-observation\nis a valuable methodology for scholars studying transna-\ntional spaces or other policy arenas. But it requires IR\nscholars to take seriously our own presence in the world\nof IR. This is not something we\u2019ve always done well:\nmany IR scholars have alluded to this dynamic, but few\nhave studied this interface empirically, and rare is the IR\nwork that reflects on the author\u2019s role in the policy world\nunder study. I argue that such reflection is necessary if\nresearchers are to aim at \u201cthe use of evidence to adjudi-\ncate between truth claims.\u201d74 The inevitable evidence of\nresearcher influence and researcher bias must be incorpo-\n\nrated into analysis, not denied, in order to maintain the\nindependence and objectivity privileged by the main-\nstream academy. And researchers have a responsibility\nboth to be biased in favor of making the world a better\nplace, and to be transparent about their normative goals\nand these goals\u2019 impact on their empirical findings. I\nconclude by fleshing out what this means for scholars\nstudying the politics of human rights.\n\nHuman Rights Scholars: Epistemic\nCommunity or Transnational\nAdvocates?\nWhere do human rights intellectuals fit into the human\nrights regime? Do scholars documenting the way human\nrights are practiced globally themselves influence the pol-\nitics of human rights? If so, what is our moral responsibil-\nity in this regard?\n\nThe need to ask this question itself is telling. Had this\nessay been published as a chapter in my book, it would\nhave seemed very puzzling to any readers outside of the\nacademic community. To friends and colleagues in Bos-\nnia, to scholar-practitioners who move easily between the\ntwo worlds with little regard for IR theory, and to informed\ncitizens, such a question must seem unbelievably arcane.\nThat it must be asked says much about the state of the\nacademic enterprise and the ways in which institutions of\nhigher learning deny their power over the human rights\nagenda.\n\nIn IR theory, two separate literatures have alluded to\nthe role played by human rights scholars in world politics,\nbut rarely have we taken the trouble to theorize our role\nexplicitly. On the one hand is the proliferating literature\non transnational advocacy networks (TANs).75 TANs are\nconsidered to be transnational networks of activists moti-\nvated by shared principled discourse and aiming to affect\npolitical behavior through moral argument.76 All social\nnetworks are \u201cnetwork[s] of meanings\u201d;77 advocacy net-\nworks are networks of principled meanings. In the area of\nhuman rights, the principled meanings have to do with\nthe rights and obligations between political actors and\nhuman beings.78 Indeed, human rights have been a sig-\nnificant focus for scholarship on TANs (alongside peace\nand the environment) precisely because these issues are\nconsidered to be primarily normative in character, and\ndesirably so.79\n\nOn the other hand is a literature on epistemic commu-\nnities, said to be distinguished not chiefly by principled\nideas but also by shared causal assumptions and analytical\nframeworks. According to Peter Haas, an epistemic com-\nmunity is \u201ca network of professionals with recognized exper-\ntise and competence in a particular domain and an\nauthoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge within\nthat domain or issue-area.\u201d80 Although this concept grew\nout of studies focusing on physical scientists\u2019 role in envi-\nronmental treaty-making,81 intelligence studies,82 and other\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nReflections | Constructing Human Rights in the Academy\n\n376 Perspectives on Politics\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Human rights scholars as a com-\nmunity possess shared principled and causal beliefs, shared\nnotions of validity, and a set of shared common practices\nassociated with the general issue area of human rights.83\n\nAnd as noted earlier, human rights scholars, like other\nintellectuals, may interface with states and other institu-\ntions of global governance in such a way as to \u201cframe how\nothers interpret problems . . . set the terms of debate . . .\nlay the groundwork for privileging certain ideas and\napproaches.\u201d84\n\nThough both the TAN literature and the epistemic com-\nmunities literature make references to intellectuals influ-\nencing human rights politics, very few studies of normative\nchange in international affairs have focused explicitly on\nthe role of social scientists working at the intersection\nbetween the normative and the empirical. Joel Oestreich\nargues that the activities of international organizations that\ndo rights-based programming are much like epistemic com-\nmunities, though they would also be considered part of\nmany advocacy networks.85 Similarly, a scholar may be on\nthe one hand committed to empirical science, aiming to\nfurther knowledge about the world as it is and on the\nother to a moral philosophy, aiming to promote a world\nas if individuals mattered.\n\nSuch are the career trajectories of notable scholar-\nactivists such as Eric Stover, who joined the American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science from the\nLondon Secretariat of Amnesty International in 1981,\nand tirelessly mobilized scientists and technical experts\nglobally in the service of human rights.86 In his award-\nwinning book Science in the Service of Human Rights,\nRichard Pierre Claude documents many cases where orga-\nnized communities of scientists used their skills specifi-\ncally to serve the cause of advancing human rights and\nfreedom, thereby interfacing deliberately with the human\nrights movement. Forensic anthropologists were pivotal\ndocumentarians of political violence behind mass graves\nin Argentina. Statisticians lent their expertise on a pro\nbono basis to United Nations investigators documenting\nrape patterns in the former Yugoslavia. Claude goes on\nto approvingly document the many ways that communi-\nties of experts have sided with NGO advocates for human\nrights, often against powerful states or multinational\ncorporations.87\n\nThe question is whether human rights scholars can do\nthis as purposively, without losing their objectivity, if the\ngoal is not to uncover human rights abuses, but to docu-\nment the human rights movement itself. My experience\nnegotiating through the overlapping worlds of science and\nadvocacy is that human rights scholars occupy both worlds\neven when we choose not to admit it; sometimes we do so\nuneasily. As a junior human rights scholar studying the\nnetwork itself and concerned with my professional inter-\nests, my instinct was to imagine myself to be outside the\n\nnetwork, observing it, or perhaps parachuting in sporad-\nically on field visits to collect data. But taking off my\nprofessor\u2019s hat at the end of the day, I found myself simply\na citizen, deeply committed to the idea of human rights,\nof child rights, and to the cause of those individuals about\nwhose lives I was writing.\n\nMoreover, I found myself functioning as an advocate\nwhether wittingly or not when I participated in briefings\nin the policy or research communities. As was suggested\nby my colleagues at Pitt, one cannot help but exert an\nagenda-setting effect simply by calling attention to under-\nserved categories of people and contrasting their circum-\nstance to the allegedly universal standards to which human\nrights advocate claim to subscribe. In this sense, my meth-\nodology was inevitably political.\n\nAt the same time, the research spoke for itself, requiring\nlittle more of me. In briefings and invited talks in the\nhumanitarian community and at universities in North\nAmerica and Europe, I participated in conversational set-\ntings where I both refined my ideas and engaged people\nfor whom these ideas seemed new and radical. Conversa-\ntions with several humanitarian practitioners confirmed\nthe significance of interactions with researchers in shaping\ntheir view of the agenda pool.\n\nCorrespondingly, my understanding of \u201cthe human\nrights network\u201d gradually expanded over the course of\nmy study. I came to realize that the transnational sites in\nwhich \u201crights talk\u201d could be heard, measured, inter-\npreted, or dampened down included the halls of aca-\ndeme, conferences, or anywhere that I as a human rights\nintellectual might give a briefing or invited talk and elicit\nconceptual or normative feedback. I recognized the power\ninherent in the project\u2019s dependence on the generosity of\nNSF panelists, conference grant committees at the Inter-\nnational Studies Association, and the goodwill of men-\ntors in communities like the International Association of\nGenocide Scholars. I recognized the gate-keeping power\nexercised, thankfully often on my behalf, by academics\nwith greater status and access than I, such as those involved\nin Andy Knight\u2019s Children and War Project at the Uni-\nversity of Alberta.\n\nBy extension, I recognized myself as a participant in the\nprocess of social construction about which I was writing. I\nbegan to see each encounter with other scholars as an\nexercise in issue construction and an opportunity to test\nand press against the conceptual boundaries of the human\nrights framework. I returned to the proceedings from the\nworking group I had created, out of sheer loneliness and a\nsense that I was out of my depth, to retrace the process by\nwhich we had developed the framework that became the\nvolume of essays Born of War. The workshop documents I\nhad produced originally out of an obligation to my fund-\ners appeared, upon a second visit, as part of the documen-\ntary record by which an understudied issue becomes\nsituated in a human rights frame. Many of the conceptual\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 377\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

We are members of communities apart, even as\nwe interface in the wider sea of the human rights move-\nment.88 But this relationship contains an important ele-\nment of complementarity. A UNICEF staffer told me that\n\u201cUNICEF can\u2019t do what independent researchers can do\n. . . can\u2019t use certain terminology, can\u2019t do long-term analy-\nsis on children and mothers. We need your perspective\nand expertise to push the envelope forward.\u201d89 It is another\nway of saying that the human rights network needs seem-\ningly objective \u201cexperts\u201d beholden to an institutional struc-\nture that pretends to privilege objective truth over the\npursuit of moral claims.90\n\nThis means that academics have power in the human\nrights network: they can function as gatekeepers, as has\nbeen well-documented, or they can function as issue entre-\npreneurs. Henri Dunant\u2019s book A Memoire of Solferino,\ndisseminated to political and social elites in the nine-\nteenth century, sparked a debate about the treatment of\nthe war-wounded that led to the drafting of the first Geneva\nConvention in 1864.91 Over the course of the next cen-\ntury, the radical idea that armed conflict might be regu-\nlated through treaties in such a way as to limit the suffering\nof human beings spread and evolved to culminate in the\nestablishment of a standing court to try individuals accused\nof atrocities.\n\nOther great advances in human rights also began with\na seminal writing by an intellectual. Raphael Lemkin\ninvented and disseminated the concept of genocide in his\ntreatise Axis Rule in Occupied Europe.92 A decade later, he\nconvinced world governments to translate the ideas in his\nbook into new international norms. Charlotte Bunch, a\nresearcher at Rutgers University, sparked the global cam-\npaign to treat violence against women as a violation of\nhuman rights in a seminal article published in Human\nRights Quarterly.93 According to Margaret Keck and Kath-\nryn Sikkink, this widely read article was decisive in shift-\ning the frame in the women\u2019s rights movement and\nembedding women\u2019s rights firmly in the mainstream human\nrights movement.94\n\nPolitical scientists who write about, interpret, and recon-\nceive human rights have a kind of political power, power\nthat we too seldom acknowledge as we play with philo-\nsophical and theoretical ideas for personal and profes-\nsional gain, power which our training gives us few skills\nwith which to wield wisely.95 My identity as a junior social\nscientist in a policy program in a Western university set-\nting shaped the way I framed and studied this issue and\nthe limits I placed on my own desire to advocate more\nforcefully for children born of war in policy settings. In\nthis sense, my own institutional location is part of the\n\nstory of how children born of war have stayed off the\nagenda, even as it is part of a new story of issue creation\nwithin the child rights regime. It is part of the answer to\nmy own research question.\n\nIf IR scholars take this claim seriously, it means those of\nus writing about rights must learn to think of ourselves as\ninside the network and think carefully about the ethics of\nthat subject position and our actions from within it. It\nalso means that studying the human rights network must\nbe a reflective enterprise. I argue that, like epistemic com-\nmunities of scientists in other issue areas, the activities,\nshared causal and normative beliefs, and everyday rules\nand practices of intellectuals requires closer study by ana-\nlysts of international normative change.\n\nLet us also take seriously our power as gatekeepers and\nthe influence we exercise when arguing that a certain set\nof claims fall outside the discourse of \u201crights.\u201d How might\nhuman rights scholars contribute responsibly to the devel-\nopment of human rights as a set of social understandings\nabout how to transform injustice into justice? Surely there\nis not one but many answers to this question. But the\nwillingness to ask the question seems, to me, to be an\nimportant starting point.\n\nNotes\n1 Smith 2003.\n2 This essay was originally written as a final chapter to\n\nmy book on the topic. See Carpenter 2010.\n3 Walt 2005.\n4 Such an approach is common in ethnomethodology\n\nand forms the basis of the \u201cbreaching experiments\u201d pop-\nularized by Harold Garfinkel. See Garfinkel 1963.\n\n5 Oestreich 2007.\n6 Indeed, feminist theorists routinely situate them-\n\nselves within their subject matter and methodolo-\ngies. For example, Baines\u2019 2004 preface to her book\nVulnerable Bodies includes a detailed autobiographi-\ncal genealogy of the work; Cohn\u2019s 2006 reflective\nanalysis of her ethnographic work on the national\nsecurity community provides first-hand insight into\nthe process of knowledge construction within the\nacademy.

Even James Rosenau,\na self-defined advocate of \u201cjailbreaks\u201d from conven-\ntional IR methodologies and disciplinary norms,\ndraws the line when it comes to encouraging undue dis-\nsidence among students: \u201cEncouraging one\u2019s stu-\ndents is anathema for me, but on the other hand, one\nis reluctant to have them risk their careers because\nthey listened to you . . . and broke with the prevailing\northodoxy prematurely.\u201d See Aydinli and Rosenau\n2004.\n\n14 Simmons 2009.

One asked\nwith a certain tone of voice, an almost imperceptible\nsigh of relief that the one asking is not the one\nanswering.\u201d\n\n24 Cohn 2006.\n25 I am deeply grateful to those who have done so.\n26 While this problem particularly impacts women, it\n\naffects fathers too. A colleague of mine, for example,\nwho had once done extensive fieldwork in Israel\nand Bosnia, told me he was now willing to work only\n\nwith established datasets because he no longer wished\nto travel away from his wife and small children.\n\n27 In fact, though I would have chosen a more long-\nterm, anthropological approach in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina had I had the opportunity, I discovered\nthat short field trips worked well for my project in\nseveral ways. For projects on sensitive topics where it\nis necessary to gain trust slowly, the process of leav-\ning and coming back rather than staying awhile and\nleaving forever can strengthen relationships with\nlocal actors.\n\n28 Cassell and Jacob 1987.\n29 Mertus 2007.\n30 Carpenter et al. 2005.\n31 Goodhart 2007.\n32 Anonymous interview, 2006.\n33 For example, Cockburn 1998 (4) wrote in the intro-\n\nduction to her book on gender and nationalism that\nshe aimed \u201cnot only to participate in and observe\nthe everyday life of the projects but also try to con-\ntribute in some pro-active way to their goals . . . I\ncould hardly ask the projects to afford me their time\nwere I not to devote some of mine to them.\u201d\n\n34 For examples and reflective essays by authors who\nhave aimed to use this approach, see Smyth and\nRobinson 2002.\n\n35 In the end I did just that. It was more descriptive\nthan laudatory; it suited Gegic without compromis-\ning my neutrality.\n\n36 For example, an anonymous reviewer on the edited\nvolume that resulted from my workshops on chil-\ndren born of war encouraged us to alter the original\ntitle, on the basis that \u201cchild protection agencies\n(like UNICEF, for example) will reject it outright\nand that would put your book in tension with its\nbiggest potential market.\u201d\n\n37 Myers 2004.\n38 So internalized are these practices that they are\n\nbarely noticed by the individuals who engage in\nthem. At the International Studies Association An-\nnual Conference in 2007, I attended a panel entitled\n\u201cMeet the Editors.\u201d The panel featured several edi-\ntors from major presses publishing books in the\ndiscipline of international relations, giving various\nremarks on the publishing business. At one point\nthe editors were asked to comment on the role of\nacademic publishers as institutions on constructing\nthe norms of international relations as a discipline,\nthrough editorial choices as to what and how to\npublish. None were genuinely able to tackle the\nquestion. Indeed I sensed that none had actually\nunderstood it.\n\n39 Finnemore and Sikkink 1998.\n40 For example, Jones\u2019s 1996 essay on gender and\n\ninternational relations theory in Review of Inter-\n\n| |\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nJune 2012 | Vol. 10/No. 2 379\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000710\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.
