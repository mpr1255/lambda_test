The \nfirst deals with the national efforts of the Yugoslav women\u2019s \numbrella alliance and its endorsement of the concepts of \nYugoslavia and a Yugoslav nation. The second analyses the \ninternational activities of Yugoslav women\u2019s organisations on \na global and regional level. It investigates the ways that \nwomen\u2019s co-operation was used to promote peaceful solutions \nto regional and international conflicts. However, the national \nand international women\u2019s movement was a social product of \nits time. Although promoting pacifism and transnational con-\ncepts, in many ways it also faced, mirrored, and sometimes \nperpetuated contemporary social and national conflicts and \nprejudices.\n\n\u201cWhat will bring happiness to the world?\u201d asked Persida Prodanovi\u0107, the \npresident of the Circle of Serbian Sisters at a meeting of the Slavic Women\u2019s \nCommittee in Prague in 1930. She immediately offered an answer: \u201cIt is not \na puzzle for a philosopher. The answer is simple: peace\u201d.1 It was common to \nlink women\u2019s conferences to transnational goals and pacifism. Newspaper \narticles reporting on the activities of the women\u2019s movement in the interwar \nperiod frequently emphasised its efforts to find peaceful solutions. However, \nwomen\u2019s organisations and conferences were places of both co-operation and \nconflict. They promoted the message of pacifism and togetherness, but they \nalso had to deal with national, political, class, or racial issues amongst their \nmembers or participants, and sometimes they even perpetuated those stereo-\ntypes and conflicts. This analysis examines the women\u2019s movement in the \nKingdom of Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1941, its endorsement of peaceful \nsolutions for national and international problems, and the obstacles, limita-\ntions, and conflicts that they did or did not manage to overcome.\n\nThe study divides in two parts. The first focuses on the ambitious endeavour \nof an umbrella organisation, the National Women\u2019s Alliance of the Kingdom \n\nCONTACT Ida Ograj\u0161ek Gorenjak iograjse@ffzg.hr iograjse@ffzg.hr Department of History Faculty of \nHumanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.\n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT                             \n2020, VOL. 31, NO. 4, 722\u2013744 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/09592296.2020.1842064\n\n\u00a9 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com\nhttps://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1080/09592296.2020.1842064&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2020-12-28\n\n\nof Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes/Yugoslav National Women\u2019s Alliance [NWA] \nto steer, overcome the cultural and political crisis of collective identity after the \ndramatic geopolitical changes in 1918, and contribute to forging Yugoslav \nnational identity. The second part deals with the international interactions of \nthe Yugoslav women\u2019s movement. The analysis investigates their efforts to \noffer solutions to major national, international, or regional problems and \npromote gender equality and pacifism.\n\nThe literature on the NWA and Yugoslav women\u2019s movement is scarce and \ninconsistent. In the 1970s, one of the first Yugoslav historians to study \nwomen\u2019s history, Jovanka Kecman, published a detailed and positivistic ana-\nlysis of the interwar women\u2019s movement in Yugoslavia. Anthropologist Lydia \nSklevicky complemented Kecman\u2019s work in research on the Antifascist \nWomen\u2019s Front in the 1980s,2 but historians of the Central and Eastern \nEuropean Successor States then lost interest in the Yugoslav women\u2019s move-\nment. They were more inclined to research specific interwar national \u2013 \nSerbian, Croatian, and Slovenian \u2013 feminist or professional women\u2019s organi-\nsations, although every analysis of the women\u2019s movement in any part of ex- \nYugoslavia inevitably mentions this Yugoslav woman\u2019s umbrella alliance.3 \n\nAnother problem is that there is no NWA archival records, and it did not \npublish its first bulletin until 1935. Therefore, knowledge of it finds basis on its \nrare and irregular annual reports, articles in various newspapers and women\u2019s \nmagazines, especially the elite and commercial Belgrade magazine, Woman \nand the World, the feminist publication Women\u2019s Movement,4 and the records \nof other women\u2019s organisations or individual women who belonged to the \nNWA. For example, the records of the Slovene feminist, Minka Govekar, are in \nthe Archives of the Republic of Slovenia and the Association of University \nWomen in Belgrade\u2019s Historical Archive and Archive of Yugoslavia. The \nArchive of Yugoslavia houses the correspondence of the royal court, and \nthose of the \u201cDrinka banovina\u201d section of the NWA sit in the archive of \nBosnia and Herzegovina.5\n\nThe Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes \u2013 Yugoslavia \u2013 emerged in \n1918 from a mosaic of South Slavic territories. The key part of the new country \nwas the 40-year-old Kingdom of Serbia ruled by the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty. By \n1918, it seemed that its wartime and political campaigns had finally paid off. \nSerbia was on the winning side of the First World War, whilst Austria- \nHungary was disintegrating. Pro-Serbian political forces dominated the poli-\ntical scene in neighbouring Montenegro and Vojvodina, at the time the south-\nern part of Hungary. Both joined the Kingdom of Serbia in November 1918. \nA few days later, the enlarged Kingdom united with the provisional State of \nSlovenes, Croats, and Serbs, an entity formed by the South Slavic parts of \na disintegrating Austria-Hungary.6 The result was the multinational and \nmulticultural Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It had three large \nreligious groups \u2013 Orthodox, Catholic, and Islamic \u2013 and three recognised \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 723\n\n\n\nnations \u2013 Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.7 Each of the latter groups had their \nhopes and doubts about the new country, but the unfavourable terms of the \nmerger shook the initial Yugoslav enthusiasm of Slovenes and Croats; and they \nstarted to feel that they had simply exchanged old oppressors \u2013 Vienna and \nBudapest \u2013 for a new one \u2013 Belgrade. On the other hand, some Serbian circles \nfeared that their hard-won independence and freedom faced weakening in the \nvague project of a multinational union. The new Kingdom\u2019s government \ntherefore faced the very delicate problem of overcoming national differences \nand fears and integrating three nations into a new political and cultural \nframework. Unfortunately, they were not very successful. Instead of improv-\ning, national relations deteriorated in the following years, reaching a low point \nafter the assassination in 1928 of Stjepan Radi\u0107, the leader of the popular \nCroatian Peasant Party. King Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 then launched \na unification project based on the compulsory assimilation of the three nations \ninto one. They would now be called Yugoslav, and the country was renamed \nthe Kingdom of Yugoslavia. With old national symbols banned, the country \nreorganised into nine administrative provinces known as banovina, usually \nnamed after rivers. Naturally, the accompanying suppression resulted in an \noutburst of nationalism, especially in Croatia.\n\nIn many ways, the umbrella organisation of Yugoslav women, the NWA, \nmirrored the activities, policies, and goals of the government. Its founding \noccurred just after unification, succeeding the tradition and inheriting the \nnetwork of the Serbia NWA \u2013 founded in 1906 \u2013 and supported and partly \nfunded by the government. It also followed an unofficial but apparent national \nhierarchy. The president of the organisation was always a Serb,8 but it was also \ncustomary that the two vice-presidents were a Croat and a Slovene. With an \ninitial proposal to use a shorter Yugoslav version of the name rejected in \nfavour of the official three-part name of the monarchy, the group changed its \nname to the Yugoslav National Women\u2019s Alliance after the country\u2019s official \npolicies turned towards Yugoslav Unitarianism. In the 1920s, the activities of \nthe alliance found basis on the co-operation of branches in the national \ncapitals \u2013 Belgrade, Zagreb, and Ljubljana, respectively \u2013 and its administrative \nstructure was reorganised into nine branches, with a special branch in \nBelgrade, in 1929.9\n\nThe NWA\u2019s establishment also responded to the International Council of \nWomen [ICW], an international umbrella women\u2019s alliance that gathered \nheterogeneous women\u2019s associations whose political orientation varied from \nvery conservative to extremely liberal. With the ICW conceived as an inter-\nnational union of national umbrella women\u2019s alliances, its very existence \ninitiated the national gathering of women\u2019s societies, thus indirectly helping \nthe national integration processes.10 Multinational countries, however, posed \na specific problem given the complex national dynamics and the resistance of \nAustrian, Czech, Hungarian, and Polish women\u2019s movements to accept a joint \n\n724 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\numbrella alliance of the old Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. The NWA, as \na member of the ICW, included charitable, conservative, feminist, or profes-\nsional organisations, and it brought together about two-thirds of all of the \nwoman\u2019s societies in Yugoslavia. At first, even though it was an umbrella \nalliance of the multinational Kingdom, it did not have to face competing \nnational women\u2019s alliances. The reason is probably that few women\u2019s organi-\nsations in Croatia and Slovenia hardly saw the point in forming the national \nalliances within old Austria-Hungary and subsequently did not develop \na tradition of national assembling. Therefore, the NWA board faced \na challenge to convince women from Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia \nHerzegovina to accept the Yugoslav alliance as their national framework. \nMoreover, since there were no alternatives, they could easily introduce them-\nselves as representatives of the whole Kingdom and the institution that could \ncontribute to the construction of the Yugoslav identity.\n\nThe NWA strongly endorsed the process of Yugoslav integration. Adopted \nin Ljubljana in 1922, the official programme emphasised the promotion of \nnational integration as its primary goal, followed by agitation on \u201cwomen\u2019s \nissues\u201d such as legal equality, equal employment and educational opportu-\nnities, the protection of children and motherhood, equal moral standards, and \nthe fight against prostitution and alcoholism.11 When the editor of Yugoslav \nWoman12 excitedly announced the formation of a women\u2019s umbrella alliance, \nshe proclaimed, \u201cWe must be aware of what\u2019s going on, we need to come \ntogether, firmly hold hands and work to raise the consciousness of national \nunity and morality . . .. Woman can do a lot!\u201d.13 Croatian writer Adela \nMil\u010dinovi\u010714 gave her impressions of the NWA\u2019s founding conference with \na comment that women from all parts of the new country, including the \n\u201coccupied regions\u201d of Dalmatia, Rijeka, Su\u0161ak, and Trieste,15 had gathered to \ndocument their love and unity.16 The management of the NWA proudly \ndeclared in its first annual report, \u201cAnd, isn\u2019t it inspiring to see that in this \nhuddled atmosphere of political separatism our women\u2019s societies from all \nparts of the homeland transcend religious and tribal differences and join forces \nfor a common good?\u201d.17 But national tensions were only part of the problem. \nThe much more challenging and ambitious task was to build a national \ncultural network from scratch. The people of Yugoslavia still had to become \naccustomed to the idea of being Yugoslav, not a Croat or Slovene in the \nHabsburg Monarchy, nor a Serb in their small, relatively newly-independent \ncountry, but a member of a completely different political and cultural com-\nmunity. This change cut deeper than politics. It affected identities. Thus, what \nactivities could they undertake to achieve such a complex goal?\n\nThe most popular promotional tools were the annual NWA meetings and \nits conferences. The politicisation of everyday life played an important part in \ncreating collective identity.18 The conferences opened space to promote \nnational emblems, symbols, and rhetoric, with even a careful choice of \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 725\n\n\n\nconference venue used as a political tool. During the 1920s, all the conferences \ntook place in the \u201cnew\u201d parts of the monarchy. Zagreb, Croatia hosted con-\nferences in 1920 and 1930, Ljubljana, Slovenia in 1922, Sarajevo, Bosnia in \n1924, Skopje, Macedonia in 1925,19 Bled, Slovenia in 1926, Novi Sad, \nVojvodina in 1928, and Split, Dalmatia/Croatia in 1929.20 The purpose of \nthis approach was to outline the new cultural scope of the young monarchy, \nbuild a Yugoslav woman\u2019s network, and promote the NWA and the idea of the \nnew national identity. The conferences usually had two parts: official and \nceremonial. In the official one, the organisation\u2019s management and national \nbranches reported on their activities. The participants also discussed impor-\ntant women\u2019s issues and possible new courses of action. The ceremonial \nportion, however, was an opportunity for propaganda. It began with \na colourful woman\u2019s parade with as many as 1,000 participants, some dressed \nin national dress from various parts of the Kingdom. It continued in \na glamorous, crowded hall, decorated with national emblems where represen-\ntatives of the royal court and national and local government made speeches. \nThe local and women\u2019s press covered and broadcast on the radio this grand \nmanifestation of women supporting national unity.21\n\nConferences were also the venues for social networking amongst members \nfrom all over the Kingdom. A host family in Belgrade in 1919 impressed an \nentrant from Zagreb. \u201cSerbian intellectuals are the people\u2019s intellectuals\u201d, she \nsaid as she departed, feeling that she had made valuable new contacts.22 Zagreb \npleasantly surprised a Serbian participant at the 1930 conference. It was very \nnice, felt like home, and the Croats are not so smug any more, she wrote in her \nreport.23 The NWA also encouraged individual contacts amongst their mem-\nber organisations, especially women of different nationalities. The Circle of \nSerbian Sisters was especially industrious in organising such gatherings.24 It \nwas one of the largest members of the NWA, with over 100 branches in Serbia, \nMacedonia, and Bosnia; and it maintained intense contacts with some \nCroatian and Slovenian societies. It was devoted to charitable and national \nwork. The first activity usually meant caring for war orphans, students, and \ncraft schools, whilst the latter included the production of national \nembroidery.25\n\nMaking folk embroideries was more than a hobby or craft; it aimed to \ncontribute to the preservation of national traditions and culture. Country life \nand the peasantry in general were perceived as \u201cthe healthy bases\u201d and keepers \nof the true essence of the nation.26 Wearing national folk dress was often \na political statement used in the ceremonies, celebrations, marches, or funerals \nof politicians. Interwar magazines often published photos of Queen Marija and \nher ladies-in-waiting dressed in costumes from different regions of the country \nthat consequently sent the message that she was queen of all of the people of \nthe monarchy.27 Therefore, the Circle of Serbian Sisters encouraged their \nmembers and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to make folk handicrafts, and they staged exhibitions \n\n726 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\nwhere women in various national folk costumes sold rugs \u2013 chilims \u2013 table-\ncloths, and other embroideries typical of the different Yugoslav regions. They \nalso organised grand balls where members of the upper class wore folk \ncostumes from all parts of the Kingdom.28 These celebrations of national \nfolk culture brought together women from the diverse towns, regions, and \nsocial milieu of Yugoslavia. The variety of national costumes at celebrations \nand exhibitions re-enforced the image of an integrated Yugoslav community \nand new Yugoslav identity.\n\nStill, images are sometimes only illusions. Whilst promoting Yugoslav \nunity, the NWA actually struggled to attract women\u2019s organisations from \nCroatia and Slovenia. Fewer than ten Slovenian delegates participated in the \nfounding conference at Belgrade, and one-half were from \u201coccupied\u201d terri-\ntories and therefore not citizens of the Kingdom. In the next two decades, the \nNWA, however, gained a better standing in Slovenia. The largest societies \nthere, the General Women\u2019s Society and the Circle of Yugoslav Sisters in \nLjubljana,29 and their distinguished members, such as writer and journalist \nGovekar, lady-in-waiting Franja Tav\u010dar, or feminist and clerk, Alojzija \u0160tebi,30 \n\nbecame active participants in the umbrella organisation. Croatia, on the other \nhand, was a tougher nut to crack. Croatian women participated in somewhat \nlarger numbers in the founding NWA conference, but their impressions were \nnot always favourable towards the umbrella alliance. Some reports feared that \nSerbian dominance within the NWA, and their understanding of Yugoslavism \nas a territorial rather than national concept, would impede the NWA potential \nto represent Croatian interests.31 Therefore, Croatian societies were somewhat \naloof in the 1920s and, during the 1922 Ljubljana conference, the Zagreb \nbranch secretary regrettably reported on the limited lobbying successes \namongst Croats. In fact, some of the Croatian organisations had decided to \nleave the NWA on political grounds.32 The NWA could rely on the Zagreb \nYugoslav Women\u2019s Association, some charitable and professional organisa-\ntions, the Zagreb branches of the Association of University Women, and the \nWomen\u2019s Movement; but one of the largest Croatian societies, Croatian \nWoman,33 never joined the NWA. Naturally, Croatian supporters of the \nYugoslav union endorsed the NWA and tried to create a positive image for \nthe umbrella alliance. One of the fiercest advocates of Yugoslavia and the \nNWA was Zofka Kveder Demetrovi\u0107, a famous Slovene author, who moved to \nZagreb after marrying a Croatian politician. She embraced Yugoslavism, \nchanged the name of her magazine to Yugoslav Women, and even started to \nwrite in Croatian. Her friend and colleague, Mil\u010dinovi\u0107, wrote less enthusiastic \nbut still favourable articles about the Alliance. Other supporters came from \na milieu of various professions that supported Yugoslavism, cosmopolitism, or \nshared some other goals of the NWA: teachers, a secretary of Croatian \nCatholic Women\u2019s Union and cofounder of Esperanto society, Danica \nBedekovi\u0107, feminist, translator, and English teacher, Mira Vodva\u0159ka \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 727\n\n\n\nKo\u010donda, and humanitarian and promoter of national embroidery, Zlata \nKova\u010di\u0107 Lopa\u0161i\u0107.34 One reason the NWA had difficulties in attracting \nCroatian and Slovene members came from the older, conservative, and nation-\nalist faction of Serbian elite women retaining an important role in managing \nthe Alliance.\n\nAt first, members of the political elite, usually wives of government minis-\nters and prominent members of the two largest Serbian women\u2019s organisations \nran the NWA: the Women\u2019s Society35 and the Circle of Serbian Sisters; but by \nmid-1920s, the first female professionals, such as teachers, writers, and lawyers \ntook it over. This classic case of a power struggle between conservative and \nprogressive factions in some ways mirrored the conflict within the ICW at the \nbeginning of the twentieth century, which led to the establishment of the \nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance \u2013 later the International Alliance of \nWomen [IAW].36 In effect, it also brought the feminist issues to the centre of \nNWA attention. The feminist and the suffragist issues were always part of \nNWA interest. During the public debate on the draft of a new constitution, the \nNWA organised many petitions, meetings, and conferences to promote the \npolitical rights of women, but without result.\n\nThe the first constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the \nVidovdan Constitution, did not prescribe rights for women, which created \na puzzling problem for the NWA37: could a pro-government organisation \npromote goals not in line with official policies? A majority of NWA members \nbelieved that it could, and they decided to include the promotion of women\u2019s \nrights in the alliance\u2019s official programme. However, Danica Hristi\u0107, the NWA \npresident, objected and resigned her position.38 Although her resignation was \nonly temporary, the progressive wing subsequently grew stronger, and it \nplotted a more decisive course for promoting legal and social rights and \nsuffrage for women. The founding of the Alliance of Feminist Societies in \n1923 \u2013 popularly called the Women\u2019s Movement \u2013 and the Association of \nUniversity Women in 1927 inevitably influenced the dynamics within the \nNWA and its willingness to promote women\u2019s suffrage and professional \nrights.39 Feminist issues dominated the conference in Skopje in 1925. The \nannual work plan highlighted the promotion of legal equality as a primary \ngoal, and Leposava Petkovi\u0107 won election as the new NWA president. She was \na teacher at the Women\u2019s Lyceum in Belgrade and president of the Yugoslav \nfeminist movement, the Yugoslav Youth Red Cross, the Little Entente of \nWomen [LEW], and obviously a candidate of the modernist faction.40\n\nThis feminist breakthrough restructured the NWA, making it more accep-\ntable to women outside the Serbian lands. But it also led to the first major crisis \nof the Alliance. The NWA became more popular in Croatia and Slovenia, but \nthe more conservative groups, mostly Serbian elite and charitable societies like \nthe Belgrade Women\u2019s Society, refused to accept the change. Therefore, the \nnext NWA conference at Bled in 1926 attracted more societies from Croatia \n\n728 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\nand Slovenia, but it also saw by a large reduction in the number of participants. \nIn a country with over 300 women\u2019s societies, only 123 sent delegates to the \nconference.41 Moreover, the conservative societies split from the NWA and \nformed their own group, the National Women\u2019s Union. The break-up shocked \nthe public. Women\u2019s magazines and the daily press followed the feud with \ninterest and usually disapproval. The Union promoted the theory that the \nwomen\u2019s movement should have two parts: general and political. As a member \nof ICW, the NWA should focus on the first, not the latter.42 In return, the \nNWA accused the Union of hypocrisy as it accused the NWA of abandoning \nnational goals; but Union members were leaving now that Croatian and \nSlovenian societies were finally joining. They were generating a \u201cmale type \nof crisis\u201d and dividing the already small Yugoslav women\u2019s movement.43 The \nconflict escalated and became more personal. Jelena Zrni\u0107, editor of Woman \nand the World, who wrote against the Union, was sued \u2013 and lost44; and pro- \nfeminist Milena Atanackovi\u0107 lost her job in the Department for the Protection \nof Children and Youth.45 Moreover, the local women\u2019s movement in Serbia \nwas suffering. Once their two largest groups, the Women\u2019s Society and Circle \nof Serbian Sisters, came into conflict, they paralysed the women\u2019s movement in \nsmall towns and villages. Instead of co-operating, members of the opposing \nsocieties started to sabotage each other.46 The NWA took active measures to \nsecure their position, pleading their case before members of the government \nand the queen, and asking for and receiving ICW support.47 Over the next few \nyears, however, tensions eased. The affair had started with a bang, but ended \nwith a whimper. Membership in the Union lost its appeal after it became \nevident that it had limited access to international organisations. Eventually, \nsome Union members simply moved back to the NWA. The next conflict, \nhowever, came from the dramatic political events that antagonised national \ngroups and ended any chance of national unity within the country and \nthe NWA.\n\nThe loose bonds between the Croatian women\u2019s movement and NWA were \nirretrievably shattered after the assassination of the leader of the most popular \nparty in Croatia, Radi\u0107. The shooting that took place in the Parliament in 1928 \npushed Yugoslavia at the brink of civil war. Historians of modern Croatian \nhistory tend to single out this event as one the key moments that ultimately \ndetermined the fate of the Kingdom. It resulted with the introduction of royal \ndictatorship and Yugoslav Unitarianism, on one hand, and disillusion with the \nYugoslav idea and outburst of Croatian nationalism, on the other; accordingly, \nrelations between Croats and Serbs remained seriously strained throughout \nthe rest of the period.48 Therefore, during the 1930s, scepticism towards \nYugoslav initiatives and institutions, the NWA included, characterised the \nCroatian women\u2019s movement, and it even tried to organise its own competi-\ntive Croatian Women\u2019s Alliance. In addition, the fiercest female supporters of \nthe Yugoslav idea were not part of Croatian society anymore. Kveder died in \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 729\n\n\n\n1926, and Mil\u010dinevi\u0107 immigrated to USA. Other women who showed a shred \nof enthusiasm for government policies were efficiently isolated from women\u2019s \nactivities in Croatia. For example, the president of the Zagreb NWA branch, \nZlata Kova\u010devi\u0107 Lopa\u0161i\u0107, found herself expelled from most of the Croatian \nassociations and clubs because of her participation in the celebration of the \nanniversary of the breakthrough on the Salonika front during the First World \nWar.49 The NWA, on the other hand, embraced official Yugoslav Unitarian \npolitics, changed its name, and reorganised its administration according to the \nnew standards. Since new government policies enforced the idea of a Unitarian \nYugoslav nation and discouraged the use of national names and emblems, the \nNWA retreated from proactive politics of national co-operation. It simply \nstarted to ignore the growing national tensions in the alliance. The celebration \nof the organisation\u2019s tenth anniversary in Zagreb in 1930 was the last NWA \nconference that took place outside of \u201cSerbian lands\u201d. During the 1930s, the \nconferences were held in the eastern part of the country: Novi Sad (1933), \nKovilja\u010da (1934) and finally Belgrade (1937, 1938). Instead, the NWA focused \non promoting the international position of Yugoslav women. It introduced \nnine working groups modelled on the committees of the ICW \u2013 peace, press, \nemigration and immigration, hygiene, education, protection of children, \nwomen\u2019s profession, citizenship, and equal moral standards.50 It hosted the \n1936 ICW conference and pushed for transnational concepts that would both \ncreate a common ground for the co-operation of women\u2019s organisations \nthroughout the country and help their standing within the international \nmovement. For example, they launched and promoted the concept of com-\nmemorating the \u201cPeace Day\u201d. From 1928, the NAW encouraged their \nbranches to organise commemorative events and publish pacifist articles on \n11 November, the day the warring parties of the First World War signed the \narmistice.51 Two years later, they introduced their concept of the \u201cPeace Day\u201d \nduring the ICW conference in Vienna, and they were very satisfied with the \nwelcoming reception and appreciation of their proposal.52 Transnational \nideas, however, had limited success in bringing the belligerent nations of the \nKingdom together, especially since their pressing problems and issues with the \nYugoslav Unitarianism remained unaddressed.\n\nNot all of its members welcomed the submissive acceptance of government \npolicies and the centralisation of the NWA. \u201cWhy should we copy the division \nof the country? Shouldn\u2019t the private sector be able to choose freely?\u201d protested \na delegate of the Belgrade societies at the Novi Sad conference.53 Accusing the \nNWA management of being too authoritarian and strict in implementing \nUnitarianism, the Slovenians disliked the use of the term \u201ctribe\u201d instead of \n\u201cnation\u201d for the different peoples in Yugoslavia; they had problems with \ndocuments written only in the Cyrillic alphabet; and they were generally \ndispleased with the status of the Slovenian language in the NWA and \nKingdom.54 \u201cI have to say that . . . even today, after 20 years of our life \n\n730 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\ntogether . . . most educated Serbs and Croats do not understand Slovenian\u201d.55 \n\nBut the loudest and fiercest protest against the NWA policies occurred during \nthe ICW Conference at Dubrovnik in 1936. Hosting this international gather-\ning was supposed to be a triumphal moment for the NWA. Dubrovnik was \nactually an intelligent choice as the conference venue, since it was already \na popular tourist destination. However, Dubrovnik was also a Croatian city, \nwhere Great Serbian ideology frequently usurped its culture and history56; and \nthe Croatian position in Dubrovnik was especially vulnerable if the country\u2019s \nnational borders were erased and political power centred in Belgrade. From \nthe perspective of Croatian women\u2019s organisations, the fact that the NWA \nhosted a conference in Dubrovnik could have meant one, or all, of three \nthings. First, the NWA simply ignored the lack of support of the major \nwomen\u2019s organisations in Croatia; second, they considered Dubrovnik part \nof Serbia\u2019s heritage in the context of Great Serbian ideology; or third, it may \nhave been another attempt to implement the politics of Yugoslav Unitarianism \nby which Dubrovnik would simply be a Yugoslav town. None of those options \nwas acceptable. In the end, Croatian Woman decided to use the conference \nvenue as an opportunity to express their own political messages and sabotage \nits activities. They arrived on the ship, Zagreb, dressed in folk costumes, and \ncarried Croatian tricolour flags, all accompanied by a brass band. After \na welcoming speech next to the statue of the celebrated seventeenth century \nCroatian poet and playwright, Ivan Gunduli\u0107,57 they declared Dubrovnik \na Croatian city and criticised the Unitarian policies of the Kingdom and \nNWA. They played Croatian music throughout the city and broke into the \nhall were the conference was taking place, provoking chaos and scandal. \nFinally, they departed on the Zagreb, accompanied by shouts of \u201cLong live \nCroatia!\u201d from the crowd. The mayor of Dubrovnik cancelled a planned \ndinner party and distributed the food to the poor. Petkovi\u0107 called an emer-\ngency meeting of the NWA where she condemned the conduct of Croatian \nWoman and rejected their accusations of the Unitarian NWA policy by \npointing out the argument that some of the organisers of the protest actually \ngave speeches on the NWA conferences in Bled ten years before. Nonetheless, \nthe whole incident disclosed suppressed national issues within the Alliance, \nand the Croatian as well as some of the Slovenian members refused to \nparticipate in the meeting.58 It is interesting that there were several articles \nin women\u2019s magazines that addressed the incident, but most authors simply \ndecided to report only on the festive part of the event.\n\nWhat had gone wrong? How did the boisterous excitement and optimism of \n1918 transform into the determined defiance of the late 1930s? It is unfair to \njudge women\u2019s organisations for failing a concept that had fallen apart at the \nnational level, but they did make several crucial mistakes. First, they did not \nemploy enough feminist arguments. National efforts might have seemed a bit \nof a stretch, but women\u2019s issues were the genuine common ground of the \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 731\n\n\n\nwomen\u2019s network across the country. The NWA came closest to representing \nall the nations in Yugoslavia when it showed more determination in promot-\ning solutions to women\u2019s problems. Second, they embraced the official author-\nitarian and Unitarian national policies. Promoting national unity seemed only \na bit exaggerated in 1920s, but it became overbearing and suffocating by the \n1930s. By accepting and promoting the official national concept of one \nYugoslav nation, the NWA identified itself with the political establishment \nand became just another institution of a despised regime. Finally, it failed to \naddress the issues amongst the Yugoslavian nations. The entire concept of \npromoting national unity found basis only on co-operation, visits, contacts, \nand festive proclamations, but the NWA was reluctant to talk about the real \nproblems. The press generously covered the conflict between the NWA\u2019s \nfeminist and traditional factions but rarely addressed the smouldering national \nconflicts in the 1930s. This approach made the proclamation of national unity \nseem only dishonest and empty propaganda.\n\nNonetheless, women from interwar Yugoslavia participated in all of the \nmajor global women\u2019s associations. The NWA succeeded the National \nWomen\u2019s Alliance of Serbia as a member of the ICW. Yugoslavs joined IAW \nat a conference at Rome in 1923. Women\u2019s magazines in the country often \nreported on the activities of the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and \nFreedom, with a Yugoslav branch of the league established in 1929. The \nAssociation of University Women was naturally a member of the \nInternational Federation of University Women.59 In addition, Yugoslav \nwomen were active in regional initiatives, the most important of which was \nLEW,60 the Slavic Women\u2019s Committee,61 and various contacts amongst \nBalkan women at the beginning of 1930s.62\n\nTaking part in the international initiatives provided an opportunity to \nhave an impact on global projects such as pacifism or suffragism. It is \ninteresting, however, that whilst national and feminist goals were often \nconflicted in the homeland, they complemented each other on the interna-\ntional level. This interweaving of nationalism and internationalism in the \nwomen\u2019s organisations remained quite consuetudinary amongst women\u2019s \nmovements of the new or newly liberated countries, and it derived from \nthe idea that the co-operation of different nationalisms constituted \ninternationalism.63 Furthermore, women from countries that were still strug-\ngling to build their international image could recognise the double potential \nof participating in women\u2019s international movement. Umbrella women\u2019s \norganisations supported their efforts to promote women\u2019s issues in their \ncountry, and the international events provided settings for advertising \nnational culture and interests at the international or regional level. \nTherefore, during the international women\u2019s conferences, one could easily \nmeet participants that wore national dresses or used some other form of \nnational symbols.\n\n732 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\nDelegates from the Yugoslavia also saw themselves as national ambassadors \nat international conferences, believing that their activities could change or \ncreate an image of their country. They understood that their role was not only \nto take an active part in creating global trends in the women\u2019s movement but \nalso to represent their country in a commendable fashion. During the con-\nferences, they took actions to promote national culture and tried to distinguish \nthemselves by prominent work. The famous Serbian writer, Isidora Sekuli\u0107,64 \n\npresented a paper on Yugoslav literature during the ICW Conference in Oslo, \nand Petkovi\u0107 gave interviews about Yugoslavia after the 1933 conference in \nStockholm, which was apparently a ringing success. \u201cThe next time I must \nbring a map of the Balkans\u201d, she concluded enthusiastically.65 They also \nbelieved that their personal achievements and standing contributed to the \ninternational image of the Kingdom. Women\u2019s magazines proudly reported \nevery election of Yugoslav women to the boards of international alliances, and \nthey showed great care about the reception of their suggestions. \u201cOur women \ndid not just stand still in Washington\u201d, proclaimed one article about the \nactivities of Yugoslav members at the 1925 ICW Conference there. This \nconference appeared a great success because of one Yugoslav member\u2019s elec-\ntion to the ICW board, and Yugoslav suggestions had been incorporated in the \nfinal text of the conference resolution.66 \u201cIf our women are like that . . . then \nthe \u2018stronger\u2019 sex must be worth something, too\u201d, they concluded.67 Five years \nlater, it became even better. Inspired by the Yugoslav example, the ICW \nConference at Vienna established an international Peace Day and recom-\nmended the Yugoslav practice as a way to celebrate it.68 Women continued \nto ponder actions that they could undertake to improve their position within \nthe international movement. Regional alliances provided unique opportunities \nto bring women of the small or new countries into the spotlight. The LEW \nmanaged to get one representative \u2013 out of 10 \u2013 onto the board of the IAW in \nLondon, and a Greek delegate won election as member of the Board.69\n\nAt the same time, international women\u2019s conferences were tools for pro-\nmoting women\u2019s issues that aimed to improve their position in the world and \nhomeland. Discussions that began at conferences in Rome, Washington, \nVienna, or Paris continued in national women\u2019s magazines or the daily \npress. Thus, the Yugoslav women\u2019s movement fully participated in global \ndebates on current topics of the time involving women. This approach was \nalso an opportunity to raise public awareness of the issues that women \nconsidered important: suffrage, dual morality, illegitimate children, citizen-\nship of married women, pacifism, and more. Participants in the international \nand national women\u2019s movement were keenly aware of such possibilities. They \nkept track of articles that covered international women\u2019s events and asked \nparticipants in national women\u2019s movements to report their findings. \nHowever, the results were sometimes discouraging.70 Hosting a conference \nwas a different story. It promoted the international women\u2019s movement in the \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 733\n\n\n\nhost country but also bolstered the reputation of a national women\u2019s move-\nment and, most important, provided an opportunity to present the host \ncountry to the world. During these conferences, it was much easier to draw \npublic attention to and elicit appreciation for women\u2019s issues. The interna-\ntional groups deliberately used this propaganda tool; for example, the LEW \nconsciously chose to hold its first conferences in member countries that did \nnot have women\u2019s suffrage. Yugoslavia hosted conferences for the majority of \ntheir international partners \u2013 LEW, Belgrade, 1924; IAW, Belgrade, 1931; the \nSlavic Committee, Belgrade, 1933; ICW, Dubrovnik 1936 \u2013 and the domestic \npress extensively covered them. Admittedly, their long-term impact was ques-\ntionable, as most of the interest tended to fade away a short time after the \nconference.\n\nMessages about pacifism had a better reception, especially in the 1920s \nand the early 1930s that were marked by projects of reconciliation and \ndisarmament. Peace-making was the leading diplomatic idea of that period. \nThe struggle to obtain and maintain lasting world peace resulted in numer-\nous pacifist initiatives, for example, the 1928 anti-war Kellogg-Briand Pact \nsigned by 63 nations, the League of Nations World Disarmament \nConference of 1932\u20131933, or the 1921\u20131922 Washington and 1925 \nLocarno conferences that aimed to normalise international relations and \nreduce armaments. The women of that time believed that their contribution \nto pacifism was not only called for but implied by their gender. Men made \nwar, but women were to make peace. It was a natural result of their \nsensitivity, motherhood, and care for the preservation of life.71 The pre-\nsumed biological inclination towards pacifism could present a problem in \nwartime but, during the interwar period, it provided a compelling argument \nin favour of women\u2019s suffrage rights and the necessity of their engagement in \npolitics. Helping women to get a better standing in the political life of their \nown countries, it also promoted women\u2019s organisations as partners in global \npolitics that led to the Joint Standing Committee of the Women\u2019s \nInternational Organisations that endorsed women\u2019s appointments to the \nvarious positions in League of Nations.72\n\nYugoslav women recognised multifarious potential by engaging in pacifist \nactivism. Doing so would promote a worthy cause; it would help their status \nwithin the international women\u2019s organisations; and it was in line with their \neffort to change a negative image of Yugoslavia/Balkans as space of entangled \nnational conflicts that ultimately ignited the Great War. The acceptance of \ntheir Peace Day motion at Vienna\u2019s ICW conference was excitedly commented \nby the Yugoslav women\u2019s press: \u201cAnd so women from our country, which so \noften has been blamed for inciting international conflicts and turmoil, has \nprovided the best example of its true pacifist nature\u201d.73 Therefore, the \nYugoslav women\u2019s movement tried to do its bit on both global and regional \nlevel.\n\n734 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\nOne of the most successful international conferences in Yugoslavia was the \nIAW conference for peace organised by the Yugoslav Alliance of Women\u2019s \nMovements in Belgrade in 1931.74 Coinciding with preparations for the World \nDisarmament Conference, this meeting sought to raise consciousness, awaken \nthe public, and mobilise women around the world to support pacifism. It \nlaunched a petition for peace signed by almost six million people ceremo-\nniously handed to the chair of the Disarmament Conference, Arthur \nHenderson, in July 1932. \u201cWomen took the initiative, now it\u2019s up to mankind \nto accept it\u201d, an article in Woman\u2019s World triumphantly concluded.75 \n\nAlthough lacking permission to sign the petition, Yugoslavian women tried \nto encourage the action with financial and moral support. Lectures on pacifism \nand demonstrations for peace and disarmament marked the aftermath of the \nIAW conference, the largest and most successful of which symbolically took \nplace at Sarajevo in 1932.76 During such events, criticism of the recourse to \nwar from a political, economic, cultural, and moral point of view occurred. \n\u201cWe must not be remembered as the generation that was responsible for the \ngreatest bloodshed in history\u201d, exclaimed the president of Yugoslav \nAssociation of University Women, Paulina Lebl-Abala.77 Still, the failure of \nthe Disarmament Conference left them embittered. During the 1933 NWA \nconference, Petkovi\u0107 looked back at the Conference with disappointment, but \nshe also proclaimed that gathering millions of signatures of women against \nwar was a laudable effort.78\n\nRegional alliances provided an opportunity for promoting pacifist solutions \nto local political problems. The LEW even organised \u201csecret meetings\u201d in \nwhich its members discussed the most important and current regional pro-\nblems. The Slavic Women\u2019s Committee pointed to two reasons why pacifism \nmight fail \u2013 pessimism and utopianism \u2013 and called for a realistic pan-Slavic \napproach, the promotion of \u201creal pacifism\u201d, and \u201chonest internationalism\u201d.79 \n\nRegional political efforts to solve the differences amongst the Balkan countries \nabetted and encouraged contacts amongst Balkan women. Women tried to \nhelp overcome these differences by re-enforcing cultural co-operation. For \nexample, Yugoslav women organised a series of \u201cBalkan Evenings\u201d, where they \nheld lectures on Greek, Bulgarian, and Romanian culture, and they sponsored \na group of Bulgarian women on a visit to Belgrade in 1933.80\n\nFinally, participants in the international women\u2019s movement could make \nthe world a better place for themselves. International activities required much \ntravelling and socialising. In her review of the LEW, \u0160tebi praised it as an \norganisation with ambitious goals but only one real achievement: the creation \nof a women\u2019s regional social network.81 Women\u2019s networking provided \nopportunities for a career or personal gain. For example, A. Hristi\u0107 and \nAtanackovi\u0107 won appointment to the boards of women\u2019s international orga-\nnisations. The International Federation of University Women and the LEW \noffered scholarships to their member countries. During their research and \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 735\n\n\n\nforeign travel, women could ask for the help and support of the local branch of \ntheir organisation.82 The LEW also tried to encourage the sale of women\u2019s \nhandicrafts. And, last but not least, women simply had a chance to have fun. \nDuring her extensive travels for the ICW conference in Edinburgh, Pavla \nHo\u010devar wrote about a visit to the British exhibition in Glasgow, concerts, \ndances, and elegant parties.83 Women\u2019s associations often organised excur-\nsions, dinners, or soir\u00e9es. Polish members of the Slavic Women\u2019s Committee \ninvited their Yugoslav counterparts for an 18-day visit in 1934. They travelled \nacross Poland, stayed with local members, and received discounted railway \ntickets.84 The International Federation of University Women developed \ndynamic tourist activities. They encouraged members to visit other countries \nand offered a number of organised trips every year. For instance, in 1931, their \nmembers could choose from tours of \u201cliterary interest\u201d across Italy, \u201chistorical \ninterest\u201d in Germany, history and art in Britain, or skiing in Norway.85\n\nHowever, women\u2019s organisations, alliances, and conferences were not \nimmune to the usual conflicts, power struggles, or stereotypes. Class, religion, \nrace, or geographical affiliation marked the boundaries of collective identity of \ninternational women\u2019s movements. Even though ICW officially pronounced \ninclusiveness towards \u201call nations, races, creeds and classes\u201d, its politics was \nmostly created and steered by wealthy white Christians from Europe or North \nAmerica. It went without saying that those women were considered superior \nto other members and therefore natural leaders of the movement.86 Women \nfrom Yugoslavia were far from the inner circles of the international alliances, \nand they often had to cope with the negative images of \u201cthe primitive Balkan\u201d \nand assumed inferiority of Slavic nations. In the subtext of articles that praised \nthe accomplishments of Yugoslav delegates, there was a constant hint of the \nnegative stereotypes of Yugoslavia that they encountered during the confer-\nences. Yugoslavs were marked as \u201ctroublemakers\u201d, the initiators of global \nconflicts, or the \u201cmost chauvinist, violent and backward country in the \nLeague of Nations\u201d.87 The Slavic Committee loudly protested against such \ndiscrimination. Whilst describing their international relations, however, they \nunconsciously used the vocabulary of imperialism. \u201cThe \u2018cultural West\u2019 under-\nestimates the Slavic nations\u201d, they concluded, and then self-critically remarked \nthat Slavic women should encourage their nations to improve themselves.88 \n\nDuring an ICW conference in Edinburgh, Ho\u010devar was surprised to discover \nthat there were participants who believed that large countries with longer and \nmore glorious histories had more rights than small countries with less accom-\nplished experiences.89\n\nFurthermore, as political conflicts could sometimes seriously interrupt \ntheir activities and burden women\u2019s international relationships, the ICW \nand IAW had to abandon most of their official international efforts during \nthe world wars. The two groups also often struggled to remain impartial in \nvarious national feuds of their members.90 One sarcastic article on the ICW \n\n736 I. GORANJAK\n\n\n\nconference at Vienna shed some light on the chaotic power struggle occur-\nring there: British women were trying to organise everything, the Bulgarians \nwere ineffective, the Austrians constantly obstructed the Czechoslovaks, \nand, every time participants from India tried to take part in discussion, \nthe meeting would grind to a halt.91 Yugoslavians contributed to those \nconflicts by their own quarrels with Bulgarians over Macedonia, or at least \nthat part of Macedonia that Serbia won during the Balkan Wars. Bulgarians \nbelieved that Macedonians were Bulgarians, and they supported the \nMacedonian separatist organisation VMRO; but Serbia claimed that \nMacedonians were Serbs and was forcing them to assimilate. This political \nconflict strained relations between Bulgarian and Yugoslavian women to \nsuch an extent that they could rarely be in the same room without starting \na fight. It prevented Bulgaria from becoming a LEW member, and it \ninfluenced the atmosphere of the meetings of the Slavic Women\u2019s \nCommittee.92\n\nYugoslav women believed it their national duty to fight the \u201cBulgarian \nassaults\u201d. An article on the 1930 conference at Prague praised the way that \nPersida Prodanovi\u0107 handled the \u201cthe Bulgarian incident\u201d, pointing out that \n\u201ceven if they [Bulgarians] would not change their mentality\u201d, they would now \nthink twice before using every opportunity to cause strife.93 It seemed that \nYugoslavian and Bulgarian women saw no other way but to act in accord with \nthe official policies of their government. Therefore, it took the acquiescence of \nthe two nations during the Balkan conferences to reduce tensions and bring \nBulgarian and Yugoslav women together. Interest and excitement met \nBulgarian attendance at 1931\u2019s IAW Conference for Peace at Belgrade. The \nIAW president, Lady Corbett Ashby, concluded: \u201cThis is a historic conference \nbecause it is the first meeting of Yugoslav and Bulgarian women since the \nwar!\u201d94\n\nThe Yugoslav women\u2019s movement participated in national, regional, \nand global politics and endorsed projects for multinational co-operation \nand peaceful solutions: Yugoslavism, disarmament, regional discussions, \nand alliances. Two major processes governed their activities: official \nnational politics and trends in the global women\u2019s movement. Most of \ntheir political initiatives only supported national or global projects, and \nthey often managed to combine their national and gender activities. They \nused women\u2019s alliances and conferences to endorse national goals, but \nthey also used national propaganda to draw public attention to women\u2019s \nissues.\n\nThe goals and means of the interwar period defined their strategies. \nConferences, alliances, charity balls, exhibitions, and trips were the plat-\nforms for encountering other national and social groups and an exchange \nof ideas. Modern media \u2013 radio and the press \u2013 made possible the public \npromotion of their concepts and messages. Taking positions in \n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT 737\n\n\n\ngovernment or international women\u2019s organisations allowed them to \ninfluence the formulation and implementation of policy, and petitions \nwere a popular democratic tool with the potential for propaganda and \npolitical influence.\n\nFinally, there is the question of success. Did they really make \na difference? Did their activities matter? It is almost too easy to say no, \nto disregard them as a \u2013 small \u2013 group of elderly women who travelled \naround the world, put on airs, and had fun in the process. Pacifism \nobviously did not succeed. The ideal of Yugoslavism fell apart a few \nyears before Yugoslavia itself, and the women\u2019s movement frequently \nstumbled in the face of the national or social conflicts, obstacles, and \nprejudices against which they were fighting. However, this would be an \nahistorical conclusion that does not give due consideration to the context \nof the time and other processes that influenced the outcome. The \nYugoslav women\u2019s movement was organised and multi-layered. It pro-\nmoted issues and positions considered important at the time. The press \noften covered its activities, its leaders were prominent figures in Yugoslav \nsociety, and the government funded, encouraged, and even censured it. It \nset clear national, global, and gender goals whilst aiming to make positive \nchanges.\n\nNotes\n\n1 \u201c\u2018\u0160ta \u0107e doneti sre\u0107u svetu.\u2019 Povodom sastanka slovenskih \u017eena u Pragu\u201d, \u017denski svet, 3 \n(March 1930), 3-4.\n\n2 J.

It brought together \nCzechoslovaks, Poles, Yugoslavs, Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Serbs, and subsequently Bulgarians. \nIts goal was to promote pan-Slavism amongst youth, the co-operation of Slavic women \nand, of course, pacifism.\n\n62 Contacts amongst Balkan women occurred during four Balkan conferences at the \nbeginning of 1930s, where delegates from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Turkey, \nand Yugoslavia presented the \u201cpublic opinion\u201d of their homelands and discussed eco-\nnomic, educational, press, and political issues in specialised committees.
