Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 368 pp., \n$95.00, \u00a365.00.\n\nBritain and the Middle East is the product of a conference organized by the\nHarry S. Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2004.\nThe third in a series, earlier conferences were devoted to the involvement\nof France and Germany in the region. In this volume, the editors set them-\nselves the ambitious task of studying both Britain\u2019s historical impact upon\nthe Middle East as well as its contemporary involvement there. The book\u2019s\nprincipal theme, as reflected in the subtitle, is the transformation of Britain\nfrom the status of leading power in the region to a role secondary to that of\nthe United States.\n\nGiven the general paucity of comparative research on imperialism in\nthe Middle East, the editors are to be commended for their attempt to deal\nwith the period of British rule in its totality. Generally when historians study\nBritish rule in the Middle East they do so by referencing its separate post\u2013\nWorld War One national constituencies, with little attention given to com-\nparisons with other British administrations (and almost none to French\nones). As a welcome attempt to help fill this lacunae in Middle East scholar-\nship, this volume can be usefully compared to other recent works such as\nD.K. Fieldhouse\u2019s Western Imperialism in the Middle East, 1914\u20131958 and\nBritish and French Mandates in Comparative Perspectives, edited by Peter\nSluglett and Nadine Meouchy, as well of course as Elizabeth Monroe\u2019s\nBritain\u2019s Moment in the Middle East (still commanding an influential pres-\nence after 40 years).\n\nThe individual contributions address a very broad range of topics. Of\nthe eighteen chapters, those papers that provide the freshest insights are\nthose that consult the widest variety of primary sources and examine criti-\ncally the visions and stereotypes underlying the strategic thinking of British\nofficials. For the mandate years, Amos Nadan focuses on the paradigms that\nguided colonial officials in their attempts to reshape the Palestinian rural\neconomy while, in a rather similar manner, Noga Efrati examines the contra-\ndictions in British practices impacting upon Iraqi women. For the post\nSecond World War era, Mordechai Bar-On considers the ramifications of\n\n\n\n328 Book Review\n\nAnthony Eden\u2019s personal self-delusions during the 1956 Suez Crisis, while\nNeil Caplan offers a highly detailed and well-documented examination of\nevolving British (as well as American) perceptions of the Arab-Israeli conflict\nin the early 1950s. Concerning more recent subjects, Wm. Roger Louis\nassesses the changing interests that determined British foreign policy\nfollowing the 1967 war, and Rosemary Hollis studies the origins and conse-\nquences of Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s decision to join the 2003 US invasion\nof Iraq.\n\nThe volume also includes some effective overviews which, though spe-\ncialists may find relatively little new in them, might usefully be considered\nfor undergraduate reading lists. In his introductory historiographical essay,\nYoav Alon draws comparisons between the large literature on British impe-\nrialism and the relatively sparse writing on British colonial rule in the\nMiddle East. For different parts of the region, Simon Smith, Uzi Rabi and\nRami Ginat and Meir Noema offer surveys of the rise, fortunes and fall of\nBritish rule. What is perhaps most useful about many of these essays is the\nextent to which they in fact challenge simplifications and generalizations of\nthe nature of Britain\u2019s suggested trajectory \u201cfrom imperial power to junior\npartner.\u201d Thus, British power is not only portrayed in many of the essays as\nmuch less than hegemonic, even at its height, but also the extent to which\nBritain played the role of a limited partner during its decline is questioned.\n\nAs with many edited volumes that are derived from conference papers,\none can take issue with the editors\u2019 choice of subjects to be included and, in\nparticular, the absences incurred (chief among them the lack of space given\nto the significance of 1958 as a turning point). But the real missed opportu-\nnity, in the mind of this reviewer, is the division of the papers into sections\norganized according to a geographic focus, rather than a thematic or chro-\nnological one. Too often the history of British rule in different Middle\nEastern regions has been treated separately, when what is needed are more\nwell crafted opportunities to see how the patterns and structures, the per-\nceptions and misperceptions, are deeply interconnected.\n\nMartin Bunton\nUniversity of Victoria\nVictoria, BC, Canada\n\n\n"}
