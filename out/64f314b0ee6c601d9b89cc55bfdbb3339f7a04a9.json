However, there are currently very few zoning\npractice examples of MPAs reported in developing countries. In this paper, an interdisciplinary method\ncombining spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA), geographic information system (GIS) and stakeholder\nconsultation to develop a zoning scheme in the multiple-use MPAs of Eritrea is illustrated. Three higher-\nlevel criteria and eight lower-level criteria are identified based on the value-focused approach to multi-\ncriteria analysis, and stakeholder preference is represented by pair-wise comparison (AHP analysis).\nSubsequently, the simple additive weighting (SAW) method is used to determine the suitability of an area\nfor each protection level using spatial analysis software. Through this study, a zoning scheme considering\nboth the scientific soundness and the practical feasibility of the Sheik Seid Marine National Park (SSMNP)\nin the Eritrean waters is proposed. The method could serve as a model for developing a zoning plan for\nthose similar cases, particularly in the developing countries with data and financial and technical limits.\n\n& 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As stated in Aichi Target 11, \u201cby 2020\u202610\nper cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular\nimportance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved\nthrough effectively and equitably managed, ecologically re-\npresentative and well-connected systems of protected areas and\nother effective area-based conservation measures and integrated\ninto the wider landscapes and seascapes\u201d [1], designating MPAs as\nan important area-based measure to protect biologically rich ha-\nbitats and thereby conserving biodiversity. However, this simple\nnumeric indicator of area coverage is the only element of Target 11,\nas there are many other crucial elements, among which effective,\nequitable biodiversity management tops the lists [2]. The primary\nimportance of zoning/zonation for effective management of MPAs\nnservation Program, Biology\nt 9000, Belgium\nhas been widely discussed in various regions [3,4].\nMultiple-use zoning means dividing the marine area into dif-\n\nferent zones in which uses are regulated to accomplish specific\ngoals [5]. The goals within each zone may vary from providing a\nhigh level of protection for marine habitats, such as nursery areas\nand breeding sites [6], to being set aside for reasonable uses (ex-\ntractive or non-extractive), including research, education, resource\nextraction, fishing, and tourism. Multiple-use zoning also identi-\nfies areas of importance or sensitivity for natural or cultural\nheritage [7].\n\nThe zoning method plays an important role in its enforcement;\nthe more transparent and objective the decision-making process\nis, the greater the likelihood of acceptance by the stakeholders and\npublic will be [8,9]. There are a few analytical tools and approaches\nto develop the zoning scheme, among which InVEST and Marxan\nhave been largely discussed recently [10]. However, there is no\n\u201cbest\u201d method because the suitability of a zoning method depends\non its ability to satisfy the features of the area to be designated,\nsuch as political and administrative issues, the objectives and the\nsize of the MPA, the availability of the baseline data, and financial\nresources.\n\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0308597X\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/marpol\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011&domain=pdf\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011&domain=pdf\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011&domain=pdf\nmailto:qhfang@xmu.edu.cn\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.011\n\n\nB.T. Habtemariam, Q. Fang / Marine Policy 63 (2016) 135\u2013143136\nTherefore the objective of this paper is to develop a suitable\nand feasible zoning method for those MPAs featuring the data,\nfinancial and technical limits that are common in the developing\ncountries, taking as an example the multiple-use Sheik Seid Mar-\nine National Park (SSMNP) in Eritrea. Using SSMNP as a case study,\nSection 2 explicitly illustrates the step-by-step zoning approach\nwith spatial multi-criteria analysis as a core component; Section 3\ndescribes the detailed results and provides further discussion of\nthe results; finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions.\n2. Methods and materials\n\nOcean zoning is an area-based management activity that di-\nvides ocean spaces based on various compatible or conflicting sea\nuses at the spatial and temporal scale [11]. Two types of MPA-re-\nlated zoning can be identified in practice: one is MPA site selection\nin a comprehensive ocean zoning, and the other is the zoning\npractice in a designated MPA. Both can be described as \u201cdeciding\nwhat to protect and what to allow where\u201d at different scales [12].\nVarious tools for MPA zoning, varying in data/information re-\nquirements, technology level and financial support, have been\napplied worldwide. Initially, more attention was paid to scientific\nrigour; as a result, the zoning process is rooted in protected species\nfeatures or their habitat assessment to evaluate the suitability of\nprotection [13,14]. However, the issue of \u201cpaper parks\u201d failing in\nthe compliance of MPAs by various users has resulted in an ar-\ngument about the effectiveness evaluation of MPAs [15\u201317]. In-\ncreasing numbers of discussions on multiple-use MPAs are also\nappearing [18]. The key principle of zoning methodologies for\nmultiple-use MPAs is the introduction of social objectives through\nFig. 1. Stud\nthe stakeholder involvement process based on the original meth-\nods considering the natural features only [10].\n\nAmong all of the MPA zoning studies, various methods, in-\ncluding geographic information systems (GIS), Marxan (with\nZones), user consultation/stakeholders involvement including\nquestionnaire surveys, economic analysis, and decision support\ntools (such as nonlinear multi-objective decision-making (MODM)\nmodels), were used [19\u201324].\n\nA trend of using high-tech tools combining GIS and decision\nsupport tools is observed from the above-described literature. The\nadvance of these technologies greatly improves the quantification\nof the zoning process and thereby benefits the visualization of the\nresults; however, it also requires high-level demands on data and\ninformation, analysis capacity and financial support, which is still a\nproblem for those developing countries. Managers anywhere ac-\ntually require timely and cost-effective techniques [25]. Therefore,\nin this study, a step-by-step method balancing scientific justifica-\ntion and practice feasibility was proposed to address the above-\ndescribed issues, using an MPA of Eritrea as a case study.\n\n2.1. Study site: Sheik Seid Marine National Park\n\nAlthough there are traditionally managed fishing-prohibited\ncoastal ecosystems (e.g., mangroves and lagoons) in some parts of\nthe country, no coastal or marine protected areas have been offi-\ncially declared in Eritrea [26]. Planning processes for MPAs are\nunderway as part of the integrated coastal zone management in-\nitiatives [27]. Currently, two islands, Sheik Seid Island and Dessie\nIsland (Fig. 1), out of the 354 largely uninhabited islands were\nproposed to be declared as marine protected areas to \u201cconserve\nthe nations\u2019 major biodiversity elements and rehabilitate some of\ny site.\n\n\n\ns. ti\non\n\n:\nsu\n\nn\ng\n\nR\nec\nre\nat\nio\nn\n:\nbi\nrd\n\nw\nat\nch\n\nin\ng/\n\nsi\nte\n\nse\nei\nn\ng\n\nM\nin\nin\ng\nof\n\ntr\nac\nu\ns\nsh\n\nel\nl\n\nC\nu\nlt\nu\nra\nl\nan\n\nd\nar\nch\n\nae\n-\n\nol\nog\n\nic\nal\n\nco\nn\nse\nrv\nat\nio\nn\n\nB\nio\nd\niv\ner\nsi\nty\n\nco\nn\nse\nrv\nat\nio\nn\n\nX\nO\n\nO\nX\n\nX\nO\n\nO\nX\n\nX\nO\n\nO\nX\n\nO\nO\n\nO\nO\n\nY\nX\n\nY\nO\n\nY\nX\n\nY\nO\n\nX\nY\n\nX\nX\n\nY\nX\n\nY\nY\n\nO\nX\n\nY\nY\n\nB.T.

A provisional MPA management plan of Sheik\nSeid Marine National Park was prepared in 2006; however, its\nimplementation has been hampered due to the fragmentation of\nsectorial management, the lack of financial support, and the ab-\nsence of management activities, especially with regard to the sea\nuse zoning design, which is the main focus of this paper [27,28].\n\nSheikh Seid Island (also known as Green Island) is one of 354\nDahlak archipelagos scattered along Eritrea's southern Red Sea\ncoast. It is a small flat island with a maximum altitude of 1 m and\nwith dense mangroves in the north and sandy shores in the south.\nThe mangrove trees and the extended inter-tidal reef flat that\ncompletely emerges at low tide makes the island a suitable area\nfor a nesting and resting site for marine birds. Further offshore,\nwithin the shallow waters, there exist patchy coral reefs. The cli-\nmate is very hot in the summer, and there is very little rain in\nwinter \u2013 the only source of its fresh water.\n\n2.2. MPA zoning approach\n\nZoning is a decision-making process that requires the evalua-\ntion of multiple land and sea attributes according to multiple\nobjectives [29]. In this study, a step-wise approach was developed\nin which spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA) is a core step\n(Fig. 2). SMCA is a process involving a sequence of activities that\nidentifies a problem based on the existing marine and coastal\nactivities and their compatibility analysis, followed by spatial\nmulti-criteria analysis aimed at defining the various criteria for\ndifferent human activities and quantitatively evaluating its suit-\nability, and ending with a recommendation for a decision (a\nFig. 2.

Identification and compatibility analysis of the existing\nactivities\n\nAs the first step, the existing human activities in SSMNP were\nidentified based on the author's fieldwork; the compatibility\namong every use was also considered (Table 1), among which the\nconflicts between recreational activities and biodiversity con-\nservation were identified as the major issues.\n\n2.2.2. Defining zoning scenarios\nThe objective of SSMNP is to ensure biodiversity conservation\n\nwhile simultaneously allowing for economic development and li-\nvelihood improvement [30,31]. Three levels of protective zones are\nlisted below [32].\n\n\ufffd Restricted access zone (no entry and no take): the zone is de-\nsigned to protect and conserve biologically significant habitats\nin a pristine condition without human activity, except for ap-\nproved scientific research.\n\n\ufffd Sanctuary zone (entry but no take): the zone provides a high\nlevel of protection, where the removal or harm of plants or\nanimals is prohibited. Activities referred to as low-impact\ntourism, such as swimming, snorkelling, diving, beach-related\nTable 3\nWeights assigned to the higher-level criteria under each zoning scenario.\n\nOption Restricted access zone Sanctuary zo\n\nCriteria NIV RCV EV NIV\n\nWeight 0.78 0.21 0.01 0.52\nactivities (sun bathing), and cultural activities (pilgrimage to the\nancient mosque located in the island), are allowed.\n\n\ufffd Habitat protection zone (entry and limited take): the zone of-\nfers a certain level of protection and allows for a range of re-\ncreational activities and subsistence fishing activities that do\nnot significantly affect habitat components, fish populations or\necological processes.\n\n2.2.3. Spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA)\nFrom the perspective of decision-making, the decision pro-\n\nblems in a zoning scheme consist of two steps. First, decision\nmakers must compare complex scenarios from socio-economic,\necological and institutional dimensions. To solve such complex\nconditions, multi-criteria analysis (MCA) can be used to integrate\ndifferent socio-economic and institutional concerns for MPA zon-\ning design [30].\n\nSecond, the decision making process involves a set of geo-\ngraphically defined alternatives, from which a choice of one or\nmore alternatives is made with respect to a given set of evaluation\ncriteria [33], making zoning schemes a spatial decision making\nissue. Spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA), refers to the appli-\ncation of MCA in a spatial context [5,30] and has therefore been\nused to address multiple-use zoning scheme decision problems in\nthis study.\n\nStep 1 defining the criteria for SSMNP. A criteria tree was developed\nfor SMCA of SSMNP zoning (Fig. 3); the indicators are relevant to\nthe SSMNP objective and are quantifiable and measurable\n[30,31,34].\n\nIn this study, raw data with regard to the biological, physical\nand social aspects of Sheik Seid Island were obtained from the\nEritrea Coastal Marine and Island Biodiversity (ECMIB) project\nsurvey, as well as a field study and interviews with personnel from\nthe Ministry of Marine Resources of Eritrea.\n\n\ufffd Natural island value (NIV): NIV is related to species diversity\nand the distribution of plant and animal communities on the\nisland, the presence of endemic or rare species, and the\nne Habitat protection zone\n\nRCV EV NIV RCV EV\n\n0.44 0.04 0.50 0.24 0.26\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Diagrammatical process of suitability evaluation.\n\nB.T. Habtemariam, Q. Fang / Marine Policy 63 (2016) 135\u2013143 139\npresence of habitats that have an important role in ecosystem\nfunctions (e.g., breeding area, and nursery area). NIV of the\nstudy area was assessed according to the three Level 4 in-\ndicators, namely, coral reef area, mangrove area, and the pre-\nsence or suitability for marine birds. The value of each indicator\nwas divided into multiple classes, and then a score was assigned\naccording to its suitability. Taking coral reef as an example, in\nthe SSMNP, the area covered by healthy coral was scored as\nmaximum suitability (score 5), and areas with the presence of\ncoral reefs were scored as 4; a 50 m buffer around the coral reef\nwas scored as medium suitability (score 3) [30]; other areas\nwere given a minimum score of 0. The available scored species\ndistribution maps were aggregated by assessing the presence/\nsuitability of each habitat and/or species based on comparative\nweighting matrices obtained from experts representing differ-\nent stakeholders. The final value map was obtained from the\nresults of the SMCA.\n\n\ufffd Recreational and cultural value (RCV): RCV is a value related to\nrecreational activity (presence of beach, suitability for swim-\nming, sun bathing, snorkelling and diving) and cultural activ-\nities (presence of archaeological sites and pilgrimage). Similar to\nthe NIV map, the RCV map was obtained using SMCA. Each sub-\ncriterion, namely, suitability for swimming, suitability for\nsnorkelling, presence of sandy beach, and presence of archae-\nological sites, was given a weight that represents its significance\nto the overall suitability measurement. Each indicator was also\n\n\n\nFig. 5. Aggregated value maps (A \u2013 NIV; B \u2013 RCV; C \u2013 EV).\n\nB.T. Habtemariam, Q. Fang / Marine Policy 63 (2016) 135\u2013143140\ndivided into different classes; taking suitability for swimming as\nan example, it was divided into five classes: shallow water with\nsandy coast (score-5), shallow water with muddy bottom (4),\nbuffer area (3), sea area (2) and other areas (1). The same\nclassification method was also applied to other RCV indicators.\n\n\ufffd Extractible-use values (EVs): EVs are the values of the areas for\nresource exploitation. EVs consider activities such as sub-\nsistence fishing, sport fishing and boating tours. Because the\nonly allowed and most dominant existing extractive use in\nSSMNP is subsistence fishing, the EV map was determined\nbased on an area's suitability of fishing or the identified tradi-\ntional fishing ground.\n\nStep 2 defining the priority weights of the criteria. A weight is a\nvalue assigned to an indicator/criterion that reflects the im-\nportance of the indicator/criterion relative to others under con-\nsideration [35]. For this analysis, a pair-wise comparison-analytic\nhierarchy process (AHP)-was applied. A pair-wise comparison\nmatrix questionnaire was prepared and distributed to the stake-\nholder representatives (seven experts from the Ministry of Tour-\nism, the Ministry of Marine Resources, marine biologist, archae-\nologist, and a law expert, among others). Preferences were in-\ndicated for one high-level criterion over another on a scale of 1\n(least importance) to 5 (extreme importance), which was later\nconverted into the matrix values [30,36]. Finally, the relative\nweights (Tables 2 and 3) were calculated using AHP analysis. The\nconsistency index (CI) result of 0.1086 (CR\u00bc0.18) indicates that the\nweight result is within the acceptable range of less than 20% CR.\n\nStep 3 suitability evaluation. In the case study of SSMNP, the suit-\nability index is estimated using the simple additive weighing\n(SAW) method (Eq. (1)).\n\nSI W X 1i i\u2211= * ( )\n\nwhere SI\u00bcoverall suitability index, Wi\u00bcweight of criterion i,\nXi\u00bcscore of criterion i, and n\u00bctotal number of criteria.\n\nUsing ArcGIS spatial analysis, these lower-level criteria maps\nwere combined in a grid that contains all classes calculated from\neach of the separate grids (see Fig. 4). Next, criteria maps were\nmultiplied by the relative importance weights of the criteria, as\nshown in Table 2. The suitability index of NIV and RCV maps was\ncomputed using the SAW method, and the Boolean Overlay\nMethod was used for the EV map because it has been strictly\nclassified into Boolean suitable or unsuitable layers with values of\n1 (traditional fishing areas) and 0 (the rest areas), respectively\n[29,35]. Finally, NIV, RCV and EV maps were calculated simply by\nmultiplying all classes with the ArcGIS spatial analysis (Fig. 5).\n\nOnce all of the maps were converted into partial suitability,\ncriteria maps were standardized to the same value range from 0 to\n1 to make them comparable. NIV and RCV maps were standardized\n\n\n\nFig. 6. Suitability under the three zoning scenarios (A \u2013 restricted access zone; B \u2013 sanctuary zone; C \u2013 habitat protection zone).\n\nB.T.

Results\n\nFinally, the draft zoning scheme was attained by selecting areas\nwith the highest suitability for each zoning scenario [29]. Subse-\nquently, the results of the selection made for the three protection\nlevels were compared. Areas that showed the highest suitability to\none zone only were directly allocated to that zone. For areas that\nwere selected for more than one zone or that were never selected\nfor any of the zoning options, their suitability values were com-\npared and the areas were assigned to the zone with the highest\nvalue (Fig. 7).\n\nIn the case that the suitability values are exactly the same or\nvery similar (e.g., healthy coral reef areas have a suitability value of\n0.56 for a restricted access zone and 0.57 for a sanctuary zone), the\nobjectives of the MPA will be taken into an account (restricted\naccess zone is preferred in this case). In addition, experts from\ndifferent stakeholder groups will be consulted to determine the\nfinal zoning scheme.\n\nIt is argued that the zonation plan should be as simple as\npossible [6]. Considering the small size of the studied MPA, di-\nviding the SSMNP area into too many zones of the three protection\nlevels would also mean greater complication and less effectiveness\nin the management of the SSMNP; thus, only three zones re-\npresenting the three protections levels were considered as follows.\n\n1. Restricted access zone: the restricted access zone includes all\nof the mangrove areas and the low-lying reef flats on the\neastern side of Sheik Seid Island. The highest suitability values\nof the restricted access zone were found within the mangrove\narea; thus, it was directly assigned to a restricted access zone.\nAddition of the low laying reef flats was found to be advanta-\ngeous for marine bird conservation because it serves as a\nfeeding ground and also acts as a buffer from their resting site,\nwhich is the mangrove.\n\n2. Sanctuary zone: sanctuary zones constitute the largest part of\nSSMNP, as one of the main objectives of the MPA is public\nawareness. Thus, the zoning result guarantees the public the\n\n\n\nFig. 7.

Habitat protection zone: the most suitable area for a habitat\nprotection zone was located in the north and northwestern part\nof the MPA. This area coincides with the traditional fishing\ngrounds. The zoning result will be helpful for its implementa-\ntion because the local community's traditional use has been\nfully considered.\n4. Discussion\n\nWithin multiple-use MPAs, zoning offers an opportunity to\nresolve use conflicts and maximize conservation efforts by spa-\ntially separating activities that pose different types and degrees of\nthreats on marine and coastal ecosystems. In this study, the major\nuse conflict was identified as the conflict between tourism and\nconservation. In the past, neither of the two responsible autho-\nrities, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Marine Re-\nsources, had full authority over the proposed MPA, even though it\nwas proposed in 2006, and there was no institutional arrangement\ncould bring both parties and other stakeholders together to dis-\ncuss on issues facing. This situation, together with different\nmanagerial, political and financial aspects, has caused the lack of\nimplementation of the MPA for years. However, the zoning process\nprovides an opportunity for all stakeholders to cooperate with\neach other toward a win\u2013win solution to address conflicts;\ntherefore, as proven around the world [13,37], zoning will have\ngreat potential as an important tool for integrated coastal man-\nagement in Eritrea, particularly for the ecosystem-based approach\nto MPAs management.\n\nThe applied zoning process with SMCA as a core step combines\nboth qualitative and quantitative data to produce more scientific\nand reasonable zoning schemes. The flexibility in data collection\nmakes SMCA more open, explicit and adaptive, especially in a\ncontext of lacking basic data, technical support and financial re-\nsources. Another advantage of SMCA techniques is that the ob-\njectives and criteria chosen by the decision making group are open\nto analysis and change if they are found to be inappropriate [31].\nMoreover, SMCA is a participatory process that ensures that all\nstakeholders\u2019 interests are represented and taken into considera-\ntion through the process of identifying the criteria and de-\ntermining their weights. The application of an SMCA-based zoning\nmethod to SSMNP in Eritrea is a good example that showcases\nsuch advantages. Even in the context of inadequate data, the areas\nmost suitable for varying levels of protection and activities that are\nallowed or not allowed in specific localities of the SSMNP can be\nidentified through SMCA-based zoning framework.\n\nArcGIS functions well for spatial analysis via mathematical\ncalculation according to priority weights, which ensured that the\ndecision makers made more objective and scientifically sound\ndecisions for SSMNP zoning schemes. Furthermore, the mapping\nresults based on ArcGIS also provide ease of scenario comparison\nfor all MPA stakeholders. This zoning draft serves as a foundation\n\n\n\nB.T. Habtemariam, Q.

Conclusion\n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs), in terms of both planning and\nmanagement, play critical roles in the global marine biodiversity\nconservation. A sound zoning approach is important not only for\nscientific justification but also for practical feasibility. The zoning\napproach for multiple-use MPAs proposed in this study takes into\naccount both the features of natural ecosystems and social de-\nmands on marine resources; therefore, it is able to guarantee\ncompliance by involving all stakeholders in the zoning process\nwhile effectively protecting the endangered species or fragile\necosystem. The case study shows that this zoning approach com-\nbining spatial multi-criteria analysis, geographic information sys-\ntems and stakeholder consultation can also function well in the\nconditions of poor data, limited technical capacities and in-\nsufficient financial resources.\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the Eritrea Coastal Marine and Island Biodiversity\n(ECMIB) project for providing data regarding the biological, phy-\nsical and social aspects of Sheik Seid Island.
