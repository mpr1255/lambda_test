In particular, we demonstrate how\ngendered Islamophobia, class status and the political geographies of Scotland are central factors for shaping\npolitical identities and political participations. First, we show that although our participants experience dis-\ncriminatory processes of gendered Islamophobia, which can result in complex barriers to participation, there is\nalso a political confidence, with many engaging in politics and civic life through a variety of mechanisms. For\nmany, participation is motivated by the understanding that it is a way of countering stereotypes of \u201cMuslim\nwomen\u201d and the multiple discriminations they face. Second, we examine how the class backgrounds of the young\nwomen influence and play a role in their political participations. We argue that class related factors such as\neducation, social mobility and social capital shape and enable their political participations. Third, we demon-\nstrate how the political geographies of Scotland have worked as a politics of belonging, engendering the par-\nticipation of many of the young Muslim women in Scottish society.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nA small but growing body of academic work has examined the po-\nlitical identities and political participations of Muslim women in\nMuslim minority contexts. This growth of interest in the political sub-\njectivities of Muslim women is, in many ways, shaped by two core\nfactors. First, it is in response to the popular framing of Muslim women\nas disengaged, submissive and apolitical and how these framings are \u2013\nin some respects \u2013 becoming more entrenched. Much of the recent re-\nsearch seeks to challenge stereotypes in public and political discourses\nand provide more nuanced examinations of the political subjectivities\nof Muslim women (Joly & Wadia, 2017; Lewicki & O'Toole, 2017; Van\nEs, 2016; 2017). This intersects with the general increase in Islamo-\nphobia in society, and the need to focus on how Muslim women think\nand respond to such discriminations. Second, a broader con-\nceptualisation of what constitutes political engagement and political\nagency has been central in enabling research to illustrate the political\nand active agency of Muslim women. For example, feminist political\ngeographers (Hyndman, 2004; Kofman, 2005; Sharp, 2007), re-\nsearchers focusing on youth, political geography and critical geopolitics\n(e.g. Benwell and Hopkins, 2016; Horschelmann, 2008; Skelton, 2010,)\nand youth and citizenship studies scholars (Harris & Roose, 2014;\nO'Toole and Gale, 2013) have been influential in broadening politics\n\nbeyond formal and global institutions to incorporate everyday, embo-\ndied and informal practices that constitute part of the political.\n\nIn order to open out the varied forms of \u2018new\u2019 participations by\nMuslim and ethnic minority young people, O'Toole and Gale (2013) talk\nabout \u2018new grammars of action\u2019, while Harris and Roose (2014) refer to\n\u2018DIY citizenship\u2019. Examples of informal and \u2018new\u2019 participations include\nonline activism, protest marching, boycotting, blogging, volunteering,\ncommunity work, mentoring and cultural outputs such as music and\nradio shows (Finlay, Hopkins, & Sanghera, 2017b). It is important to\nnote that some of these participations are not necessarily \u2018new\u2019, but\nrather they were not previously recognised in more narrow analytical\nframings of the political (e.g. Horschelmann & El Refaie, 2013). Im-\nportantly though, this reconceptualisation of what is political has\nopened out who qualifies as a political subject, and has assisted the\nrecent focus on the political participation of Muslim women, as well as\nother minorities and commonly overlooked groups. What much of this\nresearch demonstrates is rather than being non-political, subjugated or\ncompletely marginalised, many Muslim women have political agency\nand are mobilising around a range of political issues (Massoumi, 2015;\nWadia, 2015; Carland, 2016; Saeed, 2016; Joly & Wadia, 2017; Lewicki\n& O'Toole, 2017; Van Es, 2016; 2017). In the literature, two broad areas\nof political activism can be identified. The first is activism that mobi-\nlises around challenging patriarchal interpretations of Islam and sexist\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2019.102046\nReceived 24 August 2018; Received in revised form 23 May 2019; Accepted 10 July 2019\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: Robin.finlay@ncl.ac.uk (R.

A second area is political mobilizations around the\ndiscriminations, violence, stereotyping and securitization that Muslim\nwomen and Muslims in general face. In addition, research has also\nexplored how Muslim women engage with institutional and electoral\npolitics, such as voting (Joly & Wadia, 2017) and participating in\ngovernment initiatives (Rashid, 2014). Despite research illustrating\npolitical agency, scholars also assert that Muslim women often have to\nnegotiate expectations and structures within their ethnic group, in\nIslam and in the majority society, which can provide both facilitation to\nand obstacles for political participation (Joly & Wadia, 2017) There-\nfore, Muslim women are frequently situated in a distinctive position\nwhen they seek to participate in politics and in the public sphere.\n\nWe seek to contribute to this body of work on Muslim women and\npolitics, and examine how intersecting factors shape political partici-\npation for young Muslim women (15\u201327 years old) in Scotland. We take\ninfluence from Nagel and Staeheli's assertion that \u2018scholarly literature\nhas shed light on civic participation among Muslims, [but] it has\nsidelined the diversity of political identities and values that motivate\nthem\u2019 (2011, 438). This reorients the discussion towards a clear focus\non the material, spatial and discursive factors that shape political par-\nticipation or facilitate disengagement, rather than primarily focusing on\nthe type of participations. We take an intersectional approach\n(Crenshaw, 1989; Hopkins, 2017a; Mollett & Faria, 2018), and examine\nhow gender, religion, class and place intersect and shape the political\nparticipations of young Muslim women in Scotland. More specifically,\nwe demonstrate how gendered Islamophobia, class status and the po-\nlitical geographies of Scotland are central factors for shaping political\nidentities and political participations. Our focus on Scotland specifically\nis an important contribution of the paper. As Hopkins (2017b) argues,\nmuch of the literature about \u2018British Muslims\u2019 generalizes about the\nMuslim experience based on studies conducted in cities in England,\noverlooking the Muslim experience in the devolved countries and per-\nipheral regions within the UK. Indeed, Scotland offers a distinct poli-\ntical and socio-cultural context to the rest of the UK. In particular, the\npolitical geography of Scotland has been in a state of transformation,\nwith the rise in support for the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the\nIndependence Referendum in 2014. Therefore, this paper contributes to\na small but growing body of work that is attentive to the uniqueness of\nthe Scottish social and political context in relation to the experiences of\nreligious and ethnic minority groups (e.g. Botterill, Hopkins, Sanghera,\n& Arshad, 2016; Finlay et al., 2017 a & b; Hopkins, 2007, 2017b; Finlay\n& Hopkins, 2019). The youth focus is also an important aspect, con-\ntributing to an emerging body of work that specifically examines the\nexperiences of younger Muslim women (e.g Dwyer & Shah, 2009;\nMohammad, 2013). Importantly, it provides a youth focus to under-\nstandings about Muslims and political participation, something that is\nabsent in much of the existing research on Muslim political identities.\nOverall, this paper provides an intersectional analysis that is youth\nfocused, place specific and is concerned with the factors that shape\npolitical identities and political participation.\n\nIn what follows, we firstly give an overview of the study, the\nScottish context and the methods applied in the research. Second, we\nlook at the impact of gender and religion, specifically at how experi-\nences of gendered Islamophobia and sexism shapes how young Muslim\nwomen engage with politics. Third, we examine how the class back-\ngrounds of the young women influences their political participations.\nFinally, we look at how the political and socio-cultural context of\nScotland shapes and influences political identities and participations.\n\n1.1. The study and Scottish research context\n\nThe research context for this paper is upon young Muslim women\nwho are growing up in contemporary Scotland. The Muslim population\nof Scotland was 76,737 in the 2011 census, which is 1.4% of the po-\npulation, an increase of nearly 79% since 2001 (Hopkins, 2017b). Of\nthe total Muslim population, 35,496 are women and 41,241 are men.\n\nAround two-thirds of the Scottish Muslim community identify with a\nSouth Asian heritage. Just over half are aged under thirty, compared to\n36% of the total population, thus the Muslim population is a youthful\none. Glasgow is home to 42% of Scotland's Muslim population with\nsmaller concentrations in Edinburgh and Dundee. Almost 1 in 3 (31%)\nof the Muslim population was \u2018economically active\u2019 full-time during the\n2011 Census, which was significantly lower than the figure for the\nwhole population (51%).\n\nScotland is often considered a \u2018stateless nation\u2019 within the UK and\nhas many distinctive cultural and socio-political characteristics with the\n2014 independence referendum highlighting some of the distinctive\nqualities of Scotland within the UK. However, 55% of those who voted\nin the 2014 independence referendum opposed the notion that Scotland\nshould be independent from the rest of the UK. Nonetheless, the SNP\nremain the governing party of the Scottish Parliament and another in-\ndependence referendum in the near future is regularly a feature of\npolitical debate. The Scottish context then, provides a distinct and\nimportant space to examine Muslim women's experiences.\n\nOur interest in the factors that shape the political participations of\nMuslim youth warranted a qualitative approach to research that en-\nabled young people to discuss their views and explore their social\nworlds with the research team. Overall, we conducted research with 19\nMuslim women in 2016; we carried out 11 individual in-depth inter-\nviews and two focus groups with a total of eight participants. 16 of the\nparticipants were young people (aged 15\u201327 years) and 3 were aged 28\nor over. The reason we spoke to three Muslim women over 28 was\nbecause they were in publicly prominent roles (politicians and local\ncouncillors) and they could provide insights into the experiences of\nMuslim women in Scotland. 17 of those who participated lived in\nGlasgow area, and two in Edinburgh. 15 of the 19 were born in Scotland\nand around two-thirds of our participants identified as having a South\nAsian heritage. Other ethnic heritages included Indonesian, Lebanese,\nIraqi, and Malaysian. Therefore, when we use the term \u2018Muslim\u2019 in this\npaper, we are referring to a heterogeneous grouping of people who\nidentify as Muslim. The majority of the young women were from class\nbackgrounds where university was aspired to and usually achieved.\nThis illustrates a level of social mobility that is less common for those\npositioned lower down on the class spectrum. In order to recruit young\nMuslims to participate in this study, we used a process of snowballing\nby contacting relevant organizations and asking them to signpost us to\npotential participants or other organizations that work with Muslims or\nethnic minority young people. We worked with university groups,\ncolleges, secondary schools, mosques and refugee organizations.\nConsent was achieved prior to the interviews and focus groups, and we\nuse pseudonyms throughout the paper to protect confidentiality. The\nfocus groups and interviews were fully transcribed and then analysed\nby theme.\n\nOur positionality as male, white, Scottish/British and non-Muslim\nwill have influenced \u2013 to some extent - the research encounters and data\ngathered. Nonetheless, we did seek to reduce power imbalances by al-\nways utilising language, questions and information sheets that re-\ninforced the agency of the participants and the importance of hearing\nthe experiences and opinions of young Muslims.\n\n1.2. Intersecting discriminations: gendered Islamophobia and sexism\n\nTo begin to examine intersectional factors that shape political par-\nticipation, we look at gender and religion, specifically at how experi-\nences of gendered Islamophobia and sexism shapes how young Muslim\nwomen engage with politics. For the majority of the young Muslim\nwomen we spoke with, being a young woman and Muslim was seen to\nhave distinct challenges. Participants highlighted that their life worlds\nare marked by the intersecting discursive and material discriminations\nof Islamophobia, sexism and racism. Most participants expressed a clear\nunderstanding that being Muslim and female generally results in a\nmarginal social positioning, where multiple discriminations have to be\n\nR. Finlay and P. Hopkins Political Geography 74 (2019) 102046\n\n2\n\n\n\nnegotiated in everyday life. These multiple forms of discriminations are\nhighly pertinent in shaping how young Muslim women politically\nparticipate. For example, consider Linzi's views:\n\nAnd you are seeing a lot of sexism happen, a lot of sexism for Muslim\nWomen. And then there is the questions aimed at you like, \u2018oh but\nwhy \u2026 why aren't Muslim females involved in politics? And well,\nbecause this is what happens when they do get involved. They face\nall this, they face Islamophobia, sexism, they face \u2026 all these dif-\nferent issues that Muslim males perhaps wouldn't face as much. Linzi\n(16\u201318, Scottish-Arab, Glasgow)\n\nLinzi highlights the multiple discriminations that Muslim women\nface and how it creates distinctive barriers and challenges for political\nparticipation. The intersecting forces of Islamophobia and sexism can\ngenerate feelings of vulnerability and insecurity, which are exacerbated\nwhen engaging in politics and public life. Although politics can take\nplace in more private spaces, as argued in the literature (e.g. Kuss,\n2017), the participants, when discussing politics, frequently conceive it\nas something that is more often performed in the public sphere. This is\nnot to argue that they do not engage in politics in more private and\ndomestic ways, but when perceiving and discussing it, the language of\nconventional understandings of politics are frequently utilised. This\nunderstanding of politics as a public process is significant to how in-\ntersectional discriminations can politically marginalise, as the public\nsphere is a space where Muslim women can be more open to hostility\n(Hopkins, 2016; Najib and Hopkins, 2019; Tell MAMA, 2015, 2017). It\nis a space that is perceived as both racialized and gendered, more in-\nclusive to non-Muslims and to men. Moreover, the type of question -\n\u201cwhy aren't Muslim females involved in politics?\u201d - illustrates certain\ndiscourses that circulate about Muslim women, citizenship and politics.\nAgain, it is conceiving politics as something that occurs in the public\nsphere, and that Muslim women rarely participate in such public\nspaces. This question then is partly shaped by the discursive framing of\nMuslim women as disengaged from mainstream society. Moreover, the\npublic realm of politics is where one enacts traditional forms of citi-\nzenship, so such a question can been seen to query the citizenship and\nbelonging of Muslim women.\n\nA second distinctive feature of the discriminations experienced by\nyoung Muslim women, is they have to negotiate patriarchy and sexism\non two levels \u2013 within wider society and within localised Muslim and\nethnic minority \u2018communities\u2019 (Joly & Wadia, 2017). Barsha notes:\n\nWhen I was younger it was a bit difficult for me to engage [in pol-\nitics] because I would have comments left right and centre about me\nengaging through the Bangladeshi community. People would say\nlots of horrible things about it, and I actually had a few issues when I\nwas part of the Scottish Youth Parliament. Barsha (19\u201321, Scottish-\nBangladeshi, Edinburgh)\n\nHere, Barsha illustrates that patriarchy and gender norms within the\n\u2018Bangladeshi community\u2019 have made it difficult for her to engage in\npolitics. There are sections of the community that appear to disapprove\nof her active engagement in politics, which has resulted in negative\ncomments and \u2018issues\u2019 within the community. Therefore, young Muslim\nwomen can experience the active policing of their voices and partici-\npations from both inside communities and wider society. For instance,\nwhen Bahija was asked if she thought it was more difficult for young\nwomen to get involved in politics, she stated:\n\nOh yeah, without a doubt. Without a doubt! Within the BME [black\nand minority ethnic] Muslim community there is a school of thought\nthat would probably say \u2018should she be at the forefront\u2019. There is\nthat school of thought you know. And there is the indigenous po-\npulation that will look at me and think well actually \u2018Have you got a\nvoice as a Muslim women? There is that image you know about\nMuslim women. Bahija (28+, Scottish-Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nIn the quote, Bahija illustrates the two levels of patriarchal\n\ndiscriminations and stereotyping that Muslim women deal with. This \u2013\nshe asserts \u2013 make it specifically challenging for young Muslim women\nto participate politically. On the one hand, within communities, they\nhave to enact generational change and mobilise \u2018new\u2019 Muslim femi-\nninities, while on the other; they have to challenge and undermine\ngendered stereotypes of Islamophobia in wider society. All of this si-\ntuates young Muslim women in a marginalised space, where political\nparticipation and social mobility can be especially challenging. For\nsome of the participants in the research, this was certainly the case,\nwith their political agency and political subjectivities being constrained\nor completely silenced. This was more evident, we found, for the\nyounger participants (15\u201317 years old) who were still at school and had\nnot gone on to further or higher education at the time of the research.\nThe intersections of age with gender, religion and ethnicity therefore\npresents additional challenges. For example, during a focus group with\nstudents at a secondary school in Glasgow, one participant stated:\n\n\u2026 I don't I feel like I can voice my opinion because I feel like I am\ntoo scared of the reaction I am going to get. Whereas like there will\nbe things that I feel strongly but I won't write anything because I\nknow that there will be someone out there that has something to\nsay. And it kind of discourages you, but then obviously there are\npeople who are more proud and they can say it. But I feel like for a\nyoung teenage girl \u2026 the controversy of voicing my opinion, the\nabuse I would get. Abida (16\u201318, Scottish\u2013Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nAbida illustrates that she is \u2018scared\u2019 to be political and voice her\nopinion. She is discouraged by the potential abuse she could receive for\nbeing a young Muslim women who voices her political opinion. Other\nparticipants discussed how the idea of being a political figure or pur-\nsuing a political career was a daunting prospect, as they would likely\nreceive abuse and hostility. For instance, consider the following com-\nments made during a focus group conversation:\n\nAnna: I feel like you would probably get a lot of hate if you were a\npublic Muslim figure. (16\u201318, British-Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nSalma: You would have to have a lot of confidence and you would\nhave to be thick skinned. (16\u201318, Scottish-Moroccan, Glasgow)\n\nThese anxieties about politics are partly because political partici-\npation is conceived in its conventional sense, as a public spatial process\nrather than private, and this could leave young Muslim women open to\na range of hostilities, such as Islamophobia, racism and sexism. Drawing\non the work by Botterill et al. (2016, 2018, 2019) about young people's\neveryday securities, we can see that the political realm is a space that\ncould exacerbate a sense of \u2018ontological insecurity\u2019. In brief, \u2018ontolo-\ngical insecurity\u2019 is \u2018the feeling of a precarious and threatened sense of\nexistence\u2019 (Lang quoted in Botterill, Hopkins, & Sanghera, 2019, p.\n469). By not engaging in the public space of politics then, it can be\nconsidered as a strategy that is perceived to mitigate further senses of\n\u2018ontological insecurity\u2019 in a world where they already feel insecure.\nTherefore, for some participants, intersectional discrimination works to\nspatially and politically marginalise, pushing them into the private and\nsilenced spaces of society. Islamophobia, racism and sexism function to\nregulate and discipline subjectivities, making one feel insecure and\nprecarious, which can limit the social and political mobility of young\nMuslim women. This illustrates how the gendered discourses of Isla-\nmophobia can silence Muslim women, which - paradoxically - is what\nsuch discourses, try to blame on patriarchal religious practices.\n\n1.3. Mobilising against gendered Islamophobia\n\nWe have highlighted that young Muslim women have to negotiate a\nrange of discriminations and inequalities, which can marginalise them.\nFor some, this results in barriers to political participation, silencing\nthem and constraining their political subjectivities. However, we also\nobserved a political confidence in many of the young women, with\n\nR. Finlay and P. Hopkins Political Geography 74 (2019) 102046\n\n3\n\n\n\nmany engaging in politics and public life. Rather than internalising\ndiscriminations and marginalisation, they were actively resisting it\nthrough a range of political participations. The types of participations\nincorporate both institutional and non-institutional forms, with main-\nstream politics and alternative forms of political engagement of interest\nto many of the participants.\n\nA range of factors influence the political participation and political\nidentities of the young women, but we would argue that the distinctive\nways Muslim women are marginalised and discriminated against is a\ncore-underpinning factor for their political participations.\nMarginalisation \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 is engendering the active and\npolitical engagement of some young Muslim women. As bell hooks\nhighlights, marginality is \u2018much more than a site of deprivation [\u2026] it is\nalso the site of radical possibility, a space of resistance\u2019 (1989, p.206).\nOr as Hall asserts, the margins are \u2018simultaneously precarious and\ncreative\u2019 (2017, 5), where the marginalised are both constrained and\nmobilised. This notion of marginalisation very much resonates with the\nexperiences of young Muslim women in Scotland, with many at-\ntempting to resist and challenge socio-political marginalisation through\na range of political participations and activisms. This resistance to\npowerful forms of discrimination and marginalisation is something we\nhave seen in generations before, with black activism and anti-racist\nmovements from 1960s, 70s and 80s, such as Black Power and the Asian\nyouth Movement (Bloom & Martin, 2016; Ramamurthy, 2013). There-\nfore, the potential for marginality to produce creativity and resistance is\netched into the history of minority struggles. The \u2018postcolonial present\u2019\n(Nayak, 2010) then, like the colonial and postcolonial past (Jefferess,\n2008), is marked by acts of minority resistance to the continuation of\nracism, discrimination and marginalisation. It is important to note, this\nunderstanding of marginalisation is not to downplay the vulnerabilities,\nsuffering and exclusion of those marginalised, but it is to demonstrate\nthe multiple realities of marginalisation and that it can also engender\nresistance and creativity.\n\nFor the young Muslim women in the research, their participations\nare shaped by the distinctive ways their identities are framed and ste-\nreotyped. For example, consider Linzi's views:\n\nThe way I see it as being a Muslim woman, in this day and age, and\nin Britain in general, it is almost inherently political. Like everything\nends up concerning you in some way or another and it is a whole\nnew narrative from being just a Muslim in general. So I think it does\ninvolve Muslim women challenging the misconceptions about\nMuslim women, challenging it through being seen and heard. Linzi\n(16\u201318, Scottish-Arab, Glasgow)\n\nLinzi illustrates that the way Muslim women have become objects of\npolitical and media debate has worked as a politicising process, creating\na need and motivation for Muslim women to be \u2018seen and heard\u2019. For\nmany of our participants, there is awareness that they are framed dif-\nferently to Muslim men in political and popular discourse, which is\ncreating a distinct political space for Muslim women to engage in.\nUnderpinning the politicization of young Muslim women, are processes\nof misrepresentation and stereotyping. As discussed earlier in the paper,\nMuslim women are frequently characterised as submissive, apathetic,\nuninformed subjects who are hidden from the public sphere and vul-\nnerable to patriarchal practices and terrorist manipulation. As a result,\nyoung Muslim women are being motivated to engage in politics, as it\nseen as a way to challenge and undermine a range of stereotypical\ndiscourses. Consider the following extracts from a number of the par-\nticipants:\n\nIt [political participation] is to show that we, regardless of what the\nmedia says, we are not, we are not portrayed as the media shows us.\nWe can engage, we are not like, for women especially, we are not\nfully, we are not oppressed, we can engage and like it is breaking\nthose barriers. Barsha (19\u201321, Scottish-Bangladeshi, Edinburgh)\n\nAlso because people have the idea that women, Muslim women are\n\noppressed and we don't do anything at all. Because if women are\ngoing out and showing their opinion, then that is proving them\nwrong isn't it. Lara (16\u201318, British-Lebanese, Glasgow)\n\nThey [Muslim women] are finding themselves singled out in the\nnews and that\u2026 Not just because they are Muslim, but because they\nare Muslim and women \u2026. For example like David Cameron saying\nthat Muslim women are disengaged. So, I would say that perhaps\nMuslim men feel more clear that they have to answer for that. But,\nfor me, I felt that if I don't answer for that, it would generally be the\nperception that would be seen of me. Linzi (16\u201318, Scottish-Arab,\nGlasgow)\n\nIn all the above quotes, the young women demonstrate they are\nastutely aware of the prevailing stereotypes of Muslim women and that\nthey consider political participation and voicing opinion as way to\nchallenge such representations. This sentiment was highlighted in the\nmajority of interviews when discussing motivations and reasons for\nengaging in politics. Political participation is partly a strategy of re-\nsisting stereotypes of Muslim women, which in turn can challenge\nstereotypes about the religion of Islam. Other researchers have also\nobserved the strategy of reworking gendered and religious stereotypes\nby Muslim women. For example, van Es's (2016, 2017), in her research\non Dutch and Norweigan Muslim women, demonstrates that many of\nthe women in her research turn themselves into \u2018ambassadors\u2019 of Islam\nand attempt to break stereotypes of the \u2018oppressed\u2019 Muslim women\nthrough everyday interactions and public engagement. Therefore, there\nis evidence that Muslim women are becoming acutely aware of the role\nof representation in how they are marginalised, and that they are\nseeking to challenge such representations through a variety of strate-\ngies. For young Muslim women in our research, political participation -\nin its many different forms \u2013 is a way to include themselves in the\nstructures of representation, which allows them to gain some level of\ncontrol over representations. Strategies for challenging stereotypes and\npromoting positive self-representation incorporate highly public parti-\ncipations in mainstream politics and social activism, but they also in-\nclude more micro and everyday strategies of activism. For example,\nconsider the following quote:\n\nWhen you start communicating with other people when you are\ntalking to them and you are maybe talking to people of all different\nraces and backgrounds and stuff like that, it kind of helps because\nthey see you as who you are rather than what the media portrays of\nyou. So like you are more involved and you can kind of \u2026 they kind\nof \u2026 when someone meets you and they know how you are, they\ncan kind of like reflect when they see that on the TV. They can\nreflect and be like \u2026 well that is not how so and so is. That person\nthey are not that. So they can come to an understanding themselves,\nrather than just like adopting what the media says. Lara (16\u201318,\nBritish-Lebanese, Glasgow)\n\nEveryday interactions, such as speaking and communicating with\npeople from different backgrounds are a way of challenging stereotypes\nabout Muslim women. As Lara states in the above quote, this allows\nnon-Muslims to have a point of reference that challenges what they see\nand hear in media and other discourses. Therefore, through micro-\nstrategies of encounter, Muslim women's political engagement and\nsubjectivities can take shape through everyday practices and everyday\nperformances. This illustrates how minorities can strategically utilise\nencounters to challenge stereotyping, discrimination and margin-\nalisation.\n\nIn addition to the stereotyping of Muslim women, gendered\nIslamophobia - in its many guises \u2013 is shaping and motivating the po-\nlitical participation of the young Muslim women. A range of social\nactivisms and mainstream political participations are influenced by the\nincreasing climate of Islamophobia. For example, consider the fol-\nlowing quote:\n\nR. Finlay and P. Hopkins Political Geography 74 (2019) 102046\n\n4\n\n\n\nPeople can be put off from engaging because of all the Islamophobia\nthat is going around. But I think that actually makes me want to get\nmore involved to portray Islam in a better way, to challenge\nIslamophobia. Barsha (19\u201321, Scottish-Bangladeshi, Edinburgh)\n\nBarsha engages in politics mainly through institutional routes, such\nas the Scottish Youth Parliament and working with the SNP. There are a\nvariety of local and Scottish issues that motivate and shape her parti-\ncipation. But as the quote illustrates, Islamophobia is a significant un-\nderlying motivation to engage in politics. Although much of Barsha's\npolitical engagement does not directly connect with Islamophobia and\ndiscrimination, she considers political participation - per se - as a way\nfor young Muslim's to challenge and undermine gendered\nIslamophobia. Again, this is partly to do with representation, and pro-\nviding alternative images of Muslim women through greater partici-\npation. There is also an understanding that general participation in\nmore prominent positions and engagement with issues that are not\n\u2018exclusively\u2019 faith-based, is a way to challenge Islamophobic stereo-\ntypes, such as ones that construct young Muslim women as disengaged\nand apolitical.\n\nTo be visibly engaged in mainstream politics and public life is an\nimportant way to show that young Muslims are engaged in Scottish and\nUK life, which in turn, challenges Islamophobia. Drawing on work\nabout the self-representations of American Muslims by McGinty (2012),\nwe can see the resistance and participation discussed in this section is\npartly a counternarrative of citizenship and belonging. It is an attempt\nto become visible, to demonstrate an interest in and commitment to\nScottish and British society, which overall is a struggle to have their\ncitizenship recognised in the face of growing Islamophobia. In Lewicki\nand O'Toole's (2017) research, they illustrate how Muslim women make\ncitizenship claims through the \u201cdoing\u201d and \u201cundoing\u201d of social norms.\nThis notion of \u201cdoing\u201d and \u201cundoing\u201d of social norms very much re-\nsonates with the participations of the young women in the research. For\nexample, the active engagement and interest in UK and Scottish politics\ncan be seen as an act of \u201cdoing\u201d social norms. It is an engagement with\nand interest in the democratic structures and political institutions of\nScotland and the UK, which is a highly normative practice of citizen-\nship. However, it is also an act of undoing social norms, as it under-\nmines traditional notions of Muslim women as disengaged. It provides\nan alternative idea about Muslim women, one where they have greater\nrights and participate visibly in institutional politics. Moreover, it is a\nspatial process, often aiming to re-centre the identities of Muslim\nwomen out of the margins, and into more visible and public spaces.\nTherefore, although the public realm can engender a sense of insecurity\nfor some participants, for many other participants, it is perceived as a\nspace where they can undermine prejudices, and it could be argued,\nwhere they can achieve greater \u2018ontological security\u2019.\n\nAs previously discussed, gender norms and patriarchy within\nMuslim \u2018communities\u2019 is another way Muslim women are marginalised,\nand for some participants, this is another factor that shapes their par-\nticipations.\n\nI think it is very important [participation] because obviously there is\nthat, there is a whole image that you can't do it. And sometimes it\ndoes happen, where I see it myself, where you are told that you\nshouldn't get engaged too much because you might find it difficult\nfor you to get married or all this stuff. People might think you are\ntoo out there and too \u2026 not \u2026 maintaining your cultural roots. It is\nreally hard to balance, because you get told all this things, but you\nare just like I am living in Scotland and obviously that kind of thing\nwas okay in Bangladesh, but not here, and not in this day and age.\nSo obviously I feel like I fight against it. Barsha (19\u201321, Scottish-\nBangladeshi, Edinburgh)\n\nAs Barsha highlights, certain segments of the Bangladeshi Muslim\ncommunity police the behaviours and roles of Muslim women.\nHowever, instead of limiting Barsha's participations, she is resisting\n\npatriarchal gender norms by engaging in politics. Traditional gender\nnorms about the role of Muslim women are - in many respects \u2013 mo-\ntivating and stimulating Barsha to engage in politics. She considers\nparticipation as a way to undermine traditional gender norms, and as a\nway to reframe the role of young Muslim women. This illustrates a\nyouth struggle to create a generational change with respect to the role\nof women and how they should behave. It also demonstrates a cultural\nstruggle between different generations of migrants and the formation of\nmore hybrid youthful identities. Again, drawing on the work of Lewicki\nand O'Toole (2017), Barsha's participation is an undoing of social\nnorms, as it is seeking to transform the role of women in Muslim and\nBangladeshi communities. It is a strategic process to engender more\nrights and citizenship for young Muslim women. This resistance to\ngender norms was articulated by a number of participants, and political\nparticipation is seen a way to enact resistance and reframe the role of\nwomen in Muslim and ethnic minority communities.\n\nIn this section, we have demonstrated that experiences of dis-\ncrimination and marginalisation are politically mobilising many young\nMuslim women. The intersectional discriminations that surround and\ninfiltrate their identities and everyday lives shape and motivate poli-\ntical engagement. Many consider political participation \u2013 per se \u2013 as a\nway to undermine discriminations and challenge processes of margin-\nalisation. In a sense, these young women are mobilising a politics of\nresistance, and reimaging the role and image of Muslim women in\nScotland, the UK and beyond. However, as discrimination and mar-\nginalisation primarily works to silence and relegate, we need to ask;\nwhat factors are assisting these young women to participate politically\nand what mitigates the silencing impacts of marginalisation? Therefore,\nin the next section, we examine factors that assist these young women\nto resist certain impacts of marginalisation and participate politically.\n\n1.4. Class, social mobility and social capital\n\nIn this section, we advance our intersectional analysis, and examine\nhow the class backgrounds of the young women influence and play a\nrole in their political participations. In the following section, we also\nlook more closely at place, and examine how the political geographies\nand social context of Scotland shapes their participations.\n\nScholars have discussed extensively how educational inequalities,\npower imbalances and weakened socio-cultural capital can result in\npolitical marginalisation and political apathy in working class com-\nmunities (Evans & Tiley, 2017; Manning & Holmes, 2013). These class-\nbased discriminations can deter participation as they facilitate pro-\nblems with self-confidence, a lack of political networks and disen-\ngagement with the mainstream political institutions (Evans & Tiley,\n2017; Manning & Holmes, 2013; McGarvey, 2017). This illustrates how\nclass is an important factor to consider when examining why young\npeople are politically active or not. Dwyer et al.'s (2008) research with\nyoung Muslim men illustrated how class is highly significant in de-\ntermining the life chances of young Muslims in the UK. Moreover, class\nis especially important when looking at political participation, because\nas Joly and Wadia state \u2018the socio-economic situation of Muslim women\ncollectively and individually also determines their political behaviour,\nhow they choose to \u2018do politics\u2019 and the level of frequency\u2019 (2017: 160).\nWithin the context of the UK, the class status of Muslims is varied, often\ninfluenced by place of residence and ethnicity (Thapar-Bjorkert &\nSanghera, 2010). However, in general, British Muslims are considered\nsome of the most disadvantaged people living in the UK, with limited\nsocial mobility and limited access to Higher Education (HE) and the job\nmarket (Stevenson et al., 2017). Within the context of Scotland, Mus-\nlims are considered to be less disadvantaged than Muslims in other\nparts of the UK, but they are still overrepresented in deprived areas and\nface a range of challenges and discriminations (Elshayyal, 2016).\n\nThe participants who were the most actively political and involved\nin activism were at university, or had been at university. Although class\nstatus is multidimensional and complex, incorporating cultural, social,\n\nR. Finlay and P. Hopkins Political Geography 74 (2019) 102046\n\n5\n\n\n\npolitical and economic aspects (Dowling, 2009), educational status is\nsignificant, illustrating a level of social mobility that those at the lower\nend of the class spectrum struggle to achieve. Statistics in the UK shows\nthat participation of the lower classes in HE remains low, especially in\ncomparison to people from middle class and professional families (Pells,\n2016). Therefore, although it is difficult to clearly ascertain the class\nbackgrounds of the participants, especially without greater examination\nof their economic and cultural capital, their participation in HE does\nillustrate a certain degree of social mobility. We understand social\nmobility as the ability to move to another social class strata or the\nability to consolidate ones social standing (Bertaux & Thompson, 2006).\nUniversity provides education and possible further social mobility, but\nthrough networks and support it can also provide significant social\ncapital. In brief, social capital commonly refers to the potential resource\nof networks and institutions for achieving common goals (Bourdieu,\n1986; Putnam, 1995). We want to argue then, that the educational\nstatus and resulting class dynamics in the everyday lives of the young\nwomen is a significant factor in shaping political participation and\nactivism. This is most visibly illustrated through the way participants\nwere engaging in politics through university associations, such as Is-\nlamic societies and other student groups. University provides a space to\ndevelop political interests and the social capital that these societies\noffer can engender a confidence and ability to be political and politi-\ncally participate. For example, consider the two following quotes:\n\nBeing a woman I don't think I've ever felt not able to participate, but\nI do think that things like that exist and they need to be tackled\nwhen they are. But luckily I think I've had good opportunities,\neducation and support and I've never been held back because of my\ngender. Aiza (22\u201327, Scottish-Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nI mean when I ran for Student Union president I got support, full\nsupport from the Islamic Society first, and then from everybody else.\nMy parents, maybe because they were born in this country have\nalways been very supportive of everything that I do. I mean even\nlike being the first female president of the society, I got support from\nthe membership, it wasn't a radical thing, it was a natural thing - So\nyeah with myself because I've had a great support structure and I've\nnot let it stop me. Amal (22\u201327, Scottish-Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nIn the above quotes, both participants assert that they have not felt\nor experienced significant barriers to participation. Instead, they\nhighlight how their education and resulting support structures and\nnetworks have assisted them to participate in political roles. Because of\ntheir education and personal background, they have attained a rela-\ntively significant level of social capital, which provides them with\nconfidence and support networks when engaging in politics and public\naffairs. It is important to note that their political participations are not\nrestricted to the space of the university, with many also participating in\nactivist groups, volunteering and political parties in non-academic\nspaces. Therefore, the incubation of social capital and political con-\nfidence in the university space translates into participations in wider\nsociety, and \u2013 of course \u2013 this can work in reverse, with wider society\nparticipations feeding into campus politics.\n\nThe majority of the younger participants, who had not, at the time\nof the research, been to University, were nonetheless aspiring to study\nat university and were in the process of applying for a range of degree\ncourses. Their aspirations involved social mobility, and attending uni-\nversity was seen as an achievable goal and something to aspire to.\nTherefore, they conveyed a confidence and aspiration that is partly\nindicative of a class environment that aims to be socially mobile. With\nthe transition into university still pending, the political participation of\nour younger participants were more subtle and individualised, which\nwas an engagement that is neither \u2018deeply apathetic about politics nor\nunconventionally engaged\u2019 (Harris, Wyn, & Younes, 2010, p. 9). For\nHarris et al. (2010), this is a more \u2018ordinary\u2019 from of youth political\nengagement, which incorporates less spectacular activisms. This mainly\n\nrevolves around every day discussions and debates about politics. Po-\nlitical discussion was a pervasive way that the younger Muslim women\nengaged with politics, and many were highly astute at discussing po-\nlitical issues. In a sense, the political debates and policies that focus on\nMuslim communities can make young Muslim women astutely political,\nwhich they convey in everyday conversations. These more subtle forms\nof participation by younger participants are partly due to greater feel-\nings of anxiety around political engagement. The barriers to partici-\npation often experienced by Muslim women were more acutely felt by\nthe younger participants. Therefore, there are signs of youth transitions\ninto more politically active subjects because of age, social mobility,\neducation and social capital.\n\nMuslim women with a low class status and limited social mobility\ncan experience heightened marginalisation when it comes to HE, poli-\ntics and public life. The Islamic religion, for some, can be just as im-\nportant a factor as class status for motivating educational aspirations\n(Thapar-Bjorkert & Sanghera, 2010). However, coming from lower class\nbackgrounds will mean that young Muslim women have to deal with a\nrange of class-based discriminations, which when intersecting with\nreligious and gender discriminations, can make participation in HE,\npolitics and public life especially difficult. Therefore, it is critical to\nunderstand that the young Muslim women in this research come from\nmiddle-class backgrounds, where HE is aspired to and normally\nachieved, and this is a key intersecting factor that shapes and enables\ntheir political participations. Social mobility and social capital assists\nthem to engage in public life and resist the marginalizing processes of\ngendered Islamophobia. This is not to argue that class and economic\nprosperity completely mitigate against the harmful impacts of dis-\ncrimination; however, it can provide tools, strategies and creativity that\nhelp to challenge and undermine prejudice and marginalisation. Fi-\nnally, considering class status helps to illustrate the varied positioning\nand backgrounds of Muslim women in society and the heterogeneity\nwithin the category of \"Muslim woman\".\n\n1.5. Political geographies of Scotland & politics of belonging\n\nDespite receiving less attention in many intersectional discussions,\nthe context of place is another key characteristic of intersectionality\n(Hopkins, 2017a). Therefore, to understand intersecting factors that\nshape the political participation of young Muslim women, the socio-\ncultural and political contexts of where they are situated are important\nto examine. A range of place specific factors can assist, limit and shape\npolitical participation of ethnic minorities (Kuss, 2017), such as na-\ntional and localised political cultures, hierarchies of belonging and ra-\ncist and discriminatory structures and attitudes. Scotland is a national\nspace with distinctive characteristics, especially with respect to its po-\nlitical culture, and for many of the young Muslim women in the re-\nsearch, the Scottish context is a significant factor in shaping their po-\nlitical participations.\n\nOver the last 30 years, Scotland's political landscape has been in a\nstate of transformation, forging what many consider a politically and\nsocially distinct identity to other parts of the UK (Mooney, 2013). These\ndistinctions are in part a symptom of a number of political and societal\nchanges that have occurred such as the increased devolution of power\nto Scotland in the early 1990s, the formation of the Scottish Parliament\nin 1999, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the surge in\nsupport for the SNP and the Scotland Act 2016 awarding further powers\nto Scotland in the wake of the 2014 referendum (Elshayyal, 2016).\n2014 and 2015 are considered to have been highly 'tumultuous', with\n\u2018remarkable and profound developments in Scotland's political history\u2019\n(Rosie, 2015, p. 383). During these years, the rise of Scottish nation-\nalism was firmly crystalized and the build up to the independence re-\nferendum in 2014 resulted in Scottish society becoming more politi-\ncized. The EU referendum in 2016 in which every area in Scotland had\na majority vote to remain within the EU, raises the prospect of a second\nindependence referendum for Scotland, or at that very least, further\n\nR. Finlay and P. Hopkins Political Geography 74 (2019) 102046\n\n6\n\n\n\ndevolution (Elshayyal, 2016). Hopkins (2015: 92) highlights how this\nwas a politically energising period for Scottish society, stating:\n\nIt was clear from the coverage from the Scottish independence re-\nferendum that many people \u2013 including young people \u2013 were deeply\ninvolved in, and engaged by, the whole process. Many were active in\nlocal campaigning, regularly campaigning in debates about the re-\nferendum; something about the Scottish independence referendum\nclearly captured the imagination of the Scottish people.\n\nTherefore, this was also a politically transformative period for\nyoung people, with 16 and 17 year olds being granted the right to vote\nfor the first time. As a result, many commentators have argued that the\nReferendum sparked a political interest in young people, with an esti-\nmated 75% of eligible 16 and 17 year olds voting in the Referendum\n(Baxter, Tait, McLaverty, & MacLeod, 2015). Research has demon-\nstrated that young Muslims and ethnic minorities were also politicized\nby the political changes in Scotland (Finlay et al., 2017 a & b), and for\nthe young Muslim women in our research, Scottish politics has sig-\nnificantly formed and shaped their political identities. The 2014 In-\ndependence Referendum, Scottish nationalism and the SNP were all\nsignificant topics when discussing politics and political participation.\nFor example, consider the following quotes:\n\nI think especially after the Independence Referendum \u2026 then I en-\ngaged a whole lot more with Scottish politics, I mean after that I\njoined the SNP. I got \u2026 like more into politics and then chose to go\nand study politics. Linzi (16\u201318, Scottish-Arab, Glasgow)\n\nSo that independence referendum discussion was great, and there\nwas a lot of young Muslims that wanted to have their opinion on it\nand have their voices heard. Barsha (19\u201321, Scottish-Bangladeshi,\nEdinburgh)\n\nFor Linzi, Barsha and many other participants, the Scottish\nIndependence Referendum of 2014 and political moments related to the\nReferendum were a politicising process, engendering an interest in and\nengagement with Scottish mainstream politics and the future direction\nof the country. The referendum made politics pertinent and tangible in\nthe everyday lives of the young Muslim women. A precursor to the\nReferendum and the 'tumultuous' years of 2014 and 2015 was the rise of\nthe SNP and the growing support for Scottish nationalism, which is\nanother pertinent aspect to the political engagement and interests of\nmany of the young Muslim women in the research. Scottish nationalism\nis a form of \u2018minority\u2019 or \u2018sub-state\u2019 nationalism, which promotes the\nidea of Scottish home rule and an independent Scotland within the UK.\nThis was the driving force behind the Referendum in 2014, and was the\ncore overarching debate that revolved around the referendum. For\nmany of the young Muslim women in the research, Scottish nationalism\nand the idea of an independent Scotland was a political process that\nthey supported. For example, consider the following quotes:\n\nBut yeah I think the campaign captured \u2026 what we could see was\nthe successful integration, where Muslims felt Scottish, and that's\nwhy they're wanting \u2026 that's why the kind of nationalism appealed\nto them. Because it wasn't like \u2026 I think the campaign didn't dif-\nferentiate, like the result was going to be different for different, you\nknow, BME groups or ethnic people. There was going to be a, you\nknow, Scotland for everyone, I think that's where it kind of captured\nit very well. But I think young people like change and they like to\nknow that they can be part of that change. As well I think the\nMuslim vote was very much like the mainstream vote, in that, you\nknow it was part of that sort of rhetoric of change and aspiration.\nBut I think what was done very well was that they didn't separate\ndifferent groups, you know everyone's Scottish and they're making\nthis decision together. Amal (22\u201327, Scottish-Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nWell I actually believe nationalism has generally been exclusive of\npeople but I think Scottish nationalism, we have kind of redefined\n\nnationalism, and that is why I feel kind of proud of the movement if\nyou will. I find it has been really inclusive, it's not about the colour\nof your skin, and it's not about where you come from, it's about what\nyou want for Scotland \u2026 Other nationalist movements would\nprobably exclude me for my background or the colour of my skin\nand things like that, but I feel we haven't really had much of that\nhere and I feel really proud of that. Sara (22\u201327, Scottish,\nEdinburgh)\n\nIn the above quotes, Amal and Sara interpret Scottish nationalism as\ninclusive to young Muslims, demonstrating that it is often perceived as\na progressive, civic and liberal form of nationalism, rather than a\nconservative and ethnically defined one. They consider the nationalist\nmovement to be more concerned about the future direction of Scotland\nand about creating a \u2018better\u2019 Scotland, rather than it being about ethnic\nidentity and belonging. And as Linzi alludes to, the nationalist cam-\npaign and Referendum were often successful in making young Muslims\nfeel Scottish and feel like Scotland was for \u2018everyone\u2019. Before, during\nand after the 2014 Referendum, the SNP have actively sought to pro-\nmote this idea of civic nationalism and evoke a notion of inclusive\nbelonging to Scotland. Therefore, there is considered to be a distinctive\npolitical culture in Scotland to the rest of the UK, which many consider\nmore progressive and inclusive (Hepburn & Rosie, 2014; Keating,\n2010), especially with respect to migration and multiculturalism\n(Hepburn & Rosie, 2014). For the young women in the research, the\ndistinctive nature of Scottish political culture and distinct political\npolicies were often facilitating and shaping political interest and en-\ngagement. For example, consider the following quotes:\n\n\u2026 absolutely I definitely prefer Scottish politics to mainstream\npolitics, English politics. I think what we've got right, what Scotland\nhas right is it's very inclusive and more grassroots and I think the\npolitics is more in line with what the people want. Hence why we\nsaw such a sudden shift towards the SNP in the last election, and so\nmany more people that were politically disengaged actually enga-\nging. Amal (22\u201327, Scottish-Pakistani, Glasgow)\n\nWith their (SNP) economic policies and that, I'm not too keen. But\nwith their social justice element and what they are doing in terms of\nthat. I mean their whole kind of creating a healthier, fairer and more\nequal Scotland, the fact that they are recognizing social isolation,\nmental health, they are trying to put human rights at the centre of\neverything. Whereas in Westminster at the moment they want to\nscrap that, which is frightening. I think they have a more open-\nminded approach and a more inclusive approach and that is what\nappeals to me and I think it appeals to a lot of young people, re-\ngardless if they are Muslim or not in Scotland. Sara (22\u201327, Scottish,\nEdinburgh)\n\nIn the above quotes, the young women convey a positive perception\nabout certain features of the Scottish political landscape. Amal con-\nsiders Scottish politics to be more inclusive and grassroots compared to\nBritish politics, and this is making her highly engaged with the political\nculture of Scotland. Sara sees the SNP's policies and core ideology of\nScottish nationalism as inclusive and focused on social justice, which\nshe considers appealing to young Muslims and young people in general.\n\nIt is important to note that some commentators urge a cautionary\ninterpretation of the civic and inclusive nature of Scottish nationalism\nand the Scottish context (Linp\u00e4\u00e4 2018). For example, Linp\u00e4\u00e4 (2018)\nargues that SNP have evoked this notion of an inclusive Scotland\nthrough a \u2018collective amnesia\u2019 of Scotland's significant role of in the\nBritish Empire. Moreover, she argues that there \u2018seems to be a dis-\nconnect between how belonging to Scotland is imagined and articulated\nfrom above and how it is experienced from below\u2019 (2017). Importantly,\nthese critiques assist us to acknowledge that racism, xenophobia and\nsegregation remain a structuring feature of Scottish society (Davidson\net al., 2018). However, as we have illustrated, many of the young\nMuslim women in the research, who are from \u2018below\u2019 and in a minority\n\nR. Finlay and P. Hopkins Political Geography 74 (2019) 102046\n\n7\n\n\n\nposition, do interpret Scottish nationalism as inclusive and Scottish\npolitics as more progressive. Indeed, the Referendum and debates about\nindependence can be seen to be a significant political moment that\nopened up a \u2018politics of belonging\u2019 (Yuval-Davis, 2011) for the young\nMuslim women. Yuval-Davis describes the politics of belonging as \u2018not\nonly constructions of boundaries but also the inclusion or exclusion of\nparticular people, social categories and groupings within these bound-\naries by those who have the power to do this\u2019 (2011, 18). Institutional\npolitics is an exercise of power that mobilises \u2018hegemonic political\nprojects of belonging\u2019 (2011, 19). Whilst there are everyday politics of\nbelonging, where non-hegemonic subjects mobilise political projects of\nbelonging. The politics of the SNP and the shaping and promotion of\nScottish nationalism can be seen as political processes that seeks to\ncreate a project of belonging. As we have discussed, the SNP and other\nfactions of the independence movement have sought to create a politics\nof belonging that is inclusive and civic, rather than exclusive and\nethnic. In a sense, this has been an attempt to create an alternative\npolitical project of belonging, especially to that of the UK government,\nwhich in recent years, has been more focused on reinforcing boundaries\nand creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 to outsiders (Burrell et al., 2018).\nAlthough limitations have been found in the politics of belonging\nevoked by the SNP, our research illustrates that it has, for many of the\nyoung Muslim women, worked as a positive and inclusive process. In-\ndeed, the Scottish political context has opened up a space for the young\nMuslim women to mobilize their own personal politics of belonging.\nTheir participations in institutional and informal politics all works as a\nprocess of citizenship. This illustrates how re-imaginations of the na-\ntion, where inclusivity and plurality are put at the centre of the national\nnarrative, can significantly assist the belongings and participations of\nethnic minorities. Moreover, when an inclusive politics of belonging\nbecomes a core feature of a politicising moment, such as the in-\ndependence referendum in 2014, it can become more deeply concerned\nwith the fundamental characteristics and future directions of a country,\npotentially resulting in more profound impacts on belongings and\nparticipations.\n\nAlthough political framings of Scotland by the SNP can gloss over\nnon-inclusive and intolerant aspects of Scottish society, it is a political\nnarrative that seeks to celebrate diversity and promote an inclusive\nScotland, which is having positive impacts on the senses of belonging\nand political participations of many of the young Muslim women in this\nresearch. However, it is important to note other research has shown\nthat the Scottish political context has also had negative impacts for\nethnic minorities. In research by Botterill et al. (2016), they show that\nsome young ethnic minorities were made to feel insecure about their\nfuture in Scotland because of the Independence Referendum. As Yuval-\nDavis (2011) argues, politics of belonging can be interpreted and ex-\nperienced in different ways, often dependent on intersectional features\nof one's identity. Therefore, the heterogeneity and range of standpoints\nwithin categories such as young Muslim women and young ethnic\nminority will result in many different experiences and interpretations of\npolitics. For example, the age, the class positionality and resulting\neducation and social mobility of the young Muslim women in the re-\nsearch can be seen as significant factors for how they experience the\nScottish political context. This, again, illustrates the importance of\nlooking at class and place in the intersectional analysis of Muslim\nwomen.\n\n2. Conclusion\n\nThis paper contributes to scholarly understandings of the political\nparticipations and political identities of Muslim women in Muslim\nminority contexts. Following Nagel and Staeheli (2011) we have fo-\ncused on factors that shape and influence political participation. We\nhave taken an intersectional approach, analysing how gender, religion,\nclass and place intersect and shape the political participations of young\nMuslim women in Scotland. More specifically, we have demonstrated\n\nhow gendered Islamophobia, class status and the political geographies\nof Scotland are central factors for shaping political identities and po-\nlitical participations. We now make three final concluding remarks to\nhighlight the contributions of this paper.\n\nFirst, young Muslim women are positioned in a marginal and pre-\ncarious space, and experience a range of discriminations because of\ntheir intersecting gendered, racialized and religious identities. For the\nyoung women in the research, exposure to gendered Islamophobia and\nsexism are central underpinning factors that shape their political par-\nticipations. For some, it works to limit and marginalize their political\nagency, pushing them further into the marginal and private spaces of\nsociety. However, for the majority, these work as a significant mobi-\nlizing factor to engage in politics and public life. Patriarchal cultures\nand negative attention on Muslims in recent decades, particularly\nMuslim women, has contributed to an emerging space of young Muslim\nwomen's political resistance in Scottish society. Through a range of\npolitical participations, the young women are reframing what it is to be\na Muslim woman and undermining the marginalization of sexism and\ngendered Islamophobia. This contributes to understandings of \u2018the\nmargins\u2019 and marginalisation as not solely spaces of deprivation and\ndisengagement, but also spaces of resistance and politics (Hooks, 1989;\nHall, 2017). Like the colonial and postcolonial past (Jefferies, 2008),\nresistance and subversion continue to be an important strategy for\nminorities in the \u2018postcolonial present\u2019 (Nayak, 2010).\n\nSecond, understandings about Muslim women often fail to consider\ntheir diversity of backgrounds and identities. In particular, despite a\ngrowing interest in intersectionality, social class is often overlooked,\nwith class based power imbalances and discriminations partly flattened\nout. For the young women in the research, class related factors such as\neducation, social mobility and social capital were intersecting factors\nthat shape and enable their political participations. As the majority\nwere from class backgrounds where university is aspired to and often\nattained, they achieve social mobility and social capital, which assist\nthem to transgress barriers and engage in politics. Therefore, the paper\ncontributes to understandings about the centrality of social class to the\nlives and experiences of young Muslim women. Young Muslim women\nwho experience the multiple disadvantages of intersecting identity\ndiscriminations and lower class economic struggles can find engage-\nment in politics challenging. They frequently do not have the social\ncapital that can mitigate the oppressive and damaging effects of sexism\nand gendered Islamophobia, which can lead to withdrawal and disen-\ngagement. This, we would argue, illustrates the need for greater en-\ngagement with the class identities of Muslim women in scholarly re-\nsearch. Class and economic situations of young Muslim women are not\na secondary concern to other identities and characteristics, and until\nthey are better examined, our understandings of the experiences of\nMuslim women will remain partial.\n\nThird, the paper contributes to understandings about the role of\nplace and geography on the experiences and political participations of\nMuslim women and ethnic minorities. National political cultures can\nenable or limit political participations often depending on the policies\nand discourses of political parties. In Scotland, the young Muslim\nwomen have encountered a distinct political culture to other parts of\nthe UK, which many see as more progressive and inclusive, especially\nwith respect to migration, multiculturalism and social justice. The po-\nlitical moment in Scotland has worked as a politics of belonging, en-\ngendering the participation of many of the Muslim women in Scottish\nsociety. This illustrates how political culture of place, especially the\ninstitutional political culture, significantly impacts the participation,\ncitizenship, belonging and identity formations of minority commu-\nnities. Moreover, the paper shows how the context of place is a central\ncharacteristic of intersectionality, intersecting with identities such as\ngender, religion and race and ethnicity.\n\nR.
