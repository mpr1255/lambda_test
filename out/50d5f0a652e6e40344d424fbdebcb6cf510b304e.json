Aldershot:\n\nAshgate, 2009, xii\u00fe 292pp., \u00a365.00 h/b.\n\nYUWA WEI\u2019S VOLUME PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL development of the\n\nsecurities markets and a literature review of the economic functions of securities markets and\n\nthe rationalities behind takeover activities, focusing on how China exerts the function of the\n\nsecurities markets in corporate governance. This volume also investigates the legal regimes\n\ngoverning securities markets and the Chinese experience in fully exploiting the monitoring\n\nfunction of the capital market over listed companies. It also gives an analysis of the \u2018double-\n\nedged sword\u2019 development environment of China\u2019s securities markets and proposes a model\n\nwhich balances internal corporate governance and external market control in a world of\n\nglobalisation. The book is organised into four parts and each comprises three chapters, all of\n\nwhich have a strong empirical foundation and utilise comparisons with some leading corporate\n\neconomies and transitional economies.\n\nPart I provides the background for the rest of the book and discusses the economic functions\n\nof securities markets. It examines the role of social cognitive and emotional biases in economic\n\ndecisions and the effect upon market prices and resource allocation. It explains the function of\n\nspeculation, the undesirable effects as well as the economic benefits in the securities markets. It\n\nalso discusses speculative behaviour and price distortion in China\u2019s securities markets and\n\nintroduces China\u2019s efforts at controlling excessive speculation in securities dealings. The Chinese\n\nregulatory approach has been shaped by the country\u2019s political economy to a large degree and\n\nhas much been influenced by the US self-regulation model. Part I establishes that regulatory\n\nintervention is of importance to restrain the speculative behaviour of securities markets and an\n\nefficient regulatory regime should \u2018combine the strength of both governmental regulation and\n\nself-regulation\u2019 (p. 40).\n\nPart II examines the theoretical aspects of the relationship between the securities markets and\n\ncorporate governance. This part measures the potential disciplinary capacity of capital markets\n\nas an instrument of corporate accountability. It provides an overview of the development of\n\nsome mature and transitional securities markets and a comparative discussion on securities\n\nregulations and the practice of leading corporate economies and transitional economies in\n\nexerting their corporate control functions. The difference in the reforms implemented by\n\ncorporate governance is rooted in the \u2018social and political costs of carrying out the reforms\u2019 (p.\n\n95). Further, it examines how the Chinese utilise the monitoring functions of the securities\n\nmarkets to upgrade their corporate governance systems. It attempts to establish a compatible\n\nmechanism, not only recognising the social utility of the securities markets for corporate control\n\nbut also appreciating the need for limited regulatory intervention.\n\nThe core of the book, Part III, focuses on the Chinese experience of utilising the securities\n\nmarkets as an effective mechanism of corporate control and examines whether or not China\n\ncan accelerate the modernisation of governance practice through the securities markets. It\n\nargues that the development of the securities markets is shaped by their transitional social,\n\npolitical and economical circumstances. Impressive progress has been made; however,\n\nbubbles and irregularities, such as insider trading, information disclosure and other market\n\nmanipulative activities, can still be found in Chinese securities markets. This part of the\n\nbook gives detailed measures for tackling these problems. It suggests that China should\n\nreduce governmental intervention and allow the market to operate under market rules and\n\n\u2018should develop a securities regime that combines the strengths of both the market-based\n\nand bank-based approaches\u2019 (p. 137). The Chinese experience indicates that a well-\n\nfunctioning securities market and a sound corporate governance system are mutually\n\ndependent, and that the nature of its legal system and the development of the capital market\n\nare closely related.\n\nREVIEWS 183\n\n\n\nPart IV discusses China\u2019s current and future financial reforms, and the development of the\n\ncapital market and corporate governance during these times of economic globalisation. It\n\nprovides a detailed account of China\u2019s efforts in developing a capital market while combating\n\nirregularities and dealing with the challenges of globalisation, and proposes a model which\n\nbalances internal corporate governance and external market control for China. This part of the\n\nbook provides recommendations on the securities markets, the banking sector, as well as\n\nthe Renminbi exchange rate, and concludes with an assessment of how, from a corporate\n\ngovernance perspective, China could cope with international competition in a globalised world.\n\nTo further reform the enterprises in a globalised world, China needs to continue to improve its\n\ncorporate governance practice, standardise securities activities and strengthen its ability for\n\nregulatory intervention.\n\nThe author offers a comprehensive study of the topic, but why can the securities market not\n\nfunction as an economic barometer? Why are the stock dividends that the stockholders receive\n\nfar less than the stamp tax and capital gains tax charged by the authorities? Why can the\n\ninstitutional investors not be major investment groups? Does the newly established Growth\n\nEnterprise Market (GEM) Stock Board overcome the main board\u2019s defects? These questions\n\nshould be addressed in a second volume. Overall, Yuwa Wei\u2019s volume distinguishes itself from\n\nothers by providing a cross-national comparison, backed up by empirical data and case studies\n\nof the securities markets and corporate governance and their compatibility with each other. It\n\noffers some original ideas to enforce corporate management, taking into account China\u2019s\n\nhistory, politics and economic reforms. It brings fresh insights to the issue of state-owned\n\nenterprise reforms, which are of wider significance for an understanding of how the Chinese\n\neconomy changed from a planned to a market economy. In this respect, this scholarly and\n\nlucidly written volume is a good source for scholars and students as well as policy makers who\n\nseek a deeper understanding of Chinese securities markets and corporate governance during the\n\ncurrent transitional period.\n\nBeijing Normal University HUACHUN WANG \ufffd 2012\n\nBruno S. Sergi, Misinterpreting Modern Russia: Western Views of Putin and his Presidency.\n\nNew York & London: Continuum, 2009, x\u00fe 280pp., \u00a375.00 h/b.\n\nTHIS BOOK CHALLENGES THE CONVENTIONAL WESTERN interpretation of Russia, and\n\nparticularly of Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidency. The author himself has admitted that the book\n\nopposes the \u2018constant attack by Kremlinologists\u2019 on Russia (p. 2). By Kremlinologists, the\n\nauthor means the so-called top intellectual circles which, through talks, lectures and professional\n\njournal articles have \u2018misled\u2019 the international community. He argues that the best judges of\n\nRussia would be the Russian people who have provided over 70% support for Putin and have\n\nasked him to stay in power even when his term of presidency came to an end in 2008. However, it\n\nis worth pointing out that both of the presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 took place when\n\nthe entire media in Russia was working for Putin. In the first presidential elections the media was\n\nowned by oligarchs who supported the candidacy of Putin. In the second elections most of the\n\noligarchs had been ousted by Putin\u2019s regime, either in prison or in exile, and the media was\n\ndirectly controlled by the Kremlin.\n\nFurthermore, the author argues that Putin, unlike his predecessor Yel\u2019tsin, was successful\n\nbecause he was able to direct most of the proceeds of escalating exports and high global oil\n\nprices directly into general Russian economic growth. \u2018Before Putin\u2019s rule\u2019, Sergi argues, \u2018the\n\nKremlin seemed unable or unprepared to undertake any concrete measures to overcome\n\n184 REVIEWS\n\n\n"}
