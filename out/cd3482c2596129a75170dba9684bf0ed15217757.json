A. (2011). The Idea of World Government: From Ancient Times\nto the Twenty-First Century. Abingdon: Routledge, xviii + 128 pp., $138.00,\n\u00a380.00 (hardcover); $31.95, \u00a321.99 (paperback).\n\nThis tightly packed volume is the fifty-second in the Routledge Global\nInstitutions series which aims to provide a set of accessible and compre-\nhensive guides to the history, structure, and roles of international bodies.\nIt takes as its starting point that the idea of a single political organization\nfor the whole world\u2014a world government for a world state\u2014is something\nwhich has intrigued political thinkers from, as the title indicates, ancient\ntimes. Yunker aims to assess the feasibility of world government and test the\nproposition held by many that world government is not merely impractical\nbut also dangerous, by examining a range of ideas for world government\nand presenting his own proposal at the end of the work.\n\nThe majority of this short work\u2019s focus is on plans beginning with\nthe seventeenth century French writer, Emeric Cruce\u2019s, The New Cyneas\n(1623) through to a 2003 article by Alexander Wendt on the inevitability\nof a world state. In between the author lays out a selection of the proposals\nfor world government and sets them against the political and military con-\ntext in which they were written. If there is a weakness in the book, it is\nthat for parts, the context outweighs the discussion or even description of\nthe various plans to the extent that we are given only a brief explanation of\nthose on which the author decides to focus.\n\nThe first chapter examines the historical antecedents of world gov-\nernment through the conceptual overlap with Empires: both involve the\nconstruction of authoritative government covering a range of states and dif-\nfering populations. But empires have generally been fused through military\nsubjugation and Yunker is more interested in world government through\ncontract, plans, consent, and accommodation rather than through conquest.\nEven when looking at these, the book does recognise that many of the early\nplans for world government were in fact little more than calls for alliances of\nstates and kingdoms within Europe as a means of preserving peace, although\nCruce\u2019s work in the seventeenth century did differ in wishing to encompass\nall the known regions of the world.\n\nThe contract form of world government, characterised by a supra-\nnational body, is evident in Kant\u2019s Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\n\n392\n\n\n\nBook Review 393\n\n(1795) which Yunker uses as a key text for a discussion of the world\ngovernment thesis in the nineteenth century and up until the First World\nWar. Kant\u2019s plan, echoing the rationality of the Enlightenment, was built on\nthe assumptions of the unity of mankind and the acceptance of a universal\nmoral code and the toleration of differences: virtues which unfortunately\ndid not always help in the creation of supra-national bodies to preserve\npeace. With the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars which\nhad provided the political backdrop against which Kant had written, the\npolitical heads of Europe created a loose diplomatic arrangement of peri-\nodic Congresses\u2014the Concert of Europe\u2014rather than a supra-national body\nalong the lines of Kant\u2019s suggestions. But although his plan was abjured, it\nwas, in its call for a confederation of democratic states established to achieve\npeace, a key text in the development of the federalist world government\nschool of thought. However, the century which followed was not espe-\ncially fertile for world government blueprints, reflecting the relative peace in\nEurope until 1914 with even the Hague Conferences of 1898 and 1907 being\ndriven more by the Russian Tsar\u2019s attempt to restrain military ambitions and\nspending by other European states than by any progressive peace plan.\nTwo widely influential texts on the dangers of war and armaments prior to\n1914 which Yunker does cover are Ivan Bloch\u2019s La Guerre Future (1898) and\nNorman Angell\u2019s The Great Illusion (1910). But while these warned of the\ncatastrophic dangers of modern war they ran counter to a contemporary\narms race in Europe where the orthodoxy in government circles was of the\nnecessity of arms, rather than their abandonment.\n\nIf peace and world government plans follow wars or are generated\nagainst the background of international insecurity, then it is not surprising\nthat the twentieth century produced a stream of ideas on the subject. After\n1918, the federalist preference for supra-national structures became standard\nin plans for world government. Yunker notes that the League of Nations\nwas in part a nod in the direction of Kant in that it comprised a permanent\ncongress of states and had some of the structures but not the powers nor the\npolitical will to preserve peace. While not confined to Europe it still lacked\nuniversality of both membership and of values where appeals to nation-\nalism and ideology could trump those to humanity. With the onset of the\nSecond World War up to the mid-1950s when the threat of nuclear annihila-\ntion became ever present, the interest in world government took on a new\nsignificance. Many of the earlier plans and those before the Second World\nWar can be found in the 1944 volume by Wynner and Lloyd, Searchlight on\nPeace Plans: Choose Your Road to World Government, compiled at a time\nwhen hopes were high in many quarters that the proposed United Nations\nOrganization would go beyond the structures of the League of Nations and\noffer those world government enthusiasts the basis of a new order. Alas for\nthose hoping for more, the UN was to be a grave disappointment, rooted\n\n\n\n394 Book Review\n\nas it was in the dominance of great power politics and from its earliest days\nan organization beset by the divisions of the Cold War played out in a very\nopen diplomatic forum.\n\nThe disenchantment with the post-war order and the development of\nthe Cold War created a high point of interest in world government as Yunker\ndemonstrates in the endnotes, by providing a not exhaustive list of publica-\ntions related to it in the period. The titles give a flavour of the calls for change\nin international relations: Peace Through Law (1944); The World State, or The\nNew Order of Common Sense (1944); One World in the Making (1945); It\u2019s\nup to us, Federal World Government in our Time (1946); Preliminary Draft\nof a World Constitution (1948); Which Way to World Government? (1950);\nFoundations of the World Republic (1953) and World Federal Government:\nWhy? What? How? (1954). Yet extolling the virtues of world government as\nmany of these publications did, was not sufficient to dissolve the East\u2013West\ntensions of the Cold War. The period since its end in 1989 has seen a continu-\ning interest in world government especially as some of the world\u2019s problems\nmight only be fully faced through global arrangements, be they supra-\nnational or governmental and associational. Yet there remain many serious\nobjections to the possibility of world government\u2014both in its impractical-\nity: that such an expanding and diverse world population could be brought\nunder the umbrella of a single polity, and even its undesirability: that such\na polity, if created, could not be workable without grave infringements on\nhuman rights and personal liberty.\n\nHowever, Yunker still holds out some hope which he places in his\nown proposal for a Federal Union of Democratic Nations to counter the\noriginal proposition that world government is both impractical and not ben-\neficial. This Federal Union emerges as a state entity underwritten by its own\nconstitution with its own political structures of executive, legislative and\njudicial branches, its own capital city and armed force. Nation states would\nbe members while retaining their own sovereignty that did not impinge on\nthe welfare of others. It would be, for Yunker, the beginning and not the\nend of the search for world government, a starting point providing \u201ca strong\ninstitutional foundation in support of a long-run evolutionary trend toward a\nhigher level of power, authority and effectiveness while retaining its demo-\ncratic nature.\u201d The realist would see these ideas as echoes of others in earlier\nplans which came to naught because they were hopelessly unrealistic, and\nfailed to explain to their satisfaction how the political, ideological, social\nand economic differences between states and peoples, which have been\nconsistent weak spots through the generations of world government plans,\nmight be resolved. The final word for this reviewer on these plans, includ-\ning Yunker\u2019s own, were penned by Gerard Mangone in his work, The Idea\nand Practice of World Government (1951) which Yunker generously cites:\nthey are a fine and noble idea but impractical given the consistent strength\n\n\n\nBook Review 395\n\nand power of ideological and nationalistic prejudices. These sentiments are\nperhaps unfortunately no less true today than they were when written sixty\nyears ago.\n\nEdward Johnson\nBirmingham City University\n\nBirmingham, UK\n\n\n"}
