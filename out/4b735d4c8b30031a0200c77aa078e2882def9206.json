His consider-\n\nation of how the Conservative Party made use of its time in\n\nopposition does not quite fit with current theory on the topic.\n\nAs he himself states, those works that do look at the Con-\n\nservatives\u2019 \u2018periodic spells in opposition [are], in the main,\n\npreoccupied with demonstrating how these were used to\n\nrefresh Conservative ideas and organisations in preparation\n\nonce again for government\u2019 (p. 5). In contrast, this text\n\nargues that there was far too little refreshing of Conservative\n\npolicies and structures to make them ready for government.\n\nIn order to explore contemporary conservatism, Hayton\n\nmakes use of a thematic approach; he examines four issues\n\nthat pose dilemmas for the party, and which were critical\n\ncomponents of the party\u2019s slow and painful steps towards\n\nreconstruction. Many of these debates involve truly cross-\n\ncutting issues that go beyond the left-right dimension and\n\nso are able to bring new perspectives to the Conservative\n\nParty. There are chapters on \u2018social liberalism versus social\n\ntraditionalism\u2019 and the issues brought about by the political\n\neconomy of 21st-century conservatism, but the more thor-\n\nough and perceptive chapters are the first two. The \u2018Eur-\n\nopean question\u2019 is explored thoroughly. Likewise, the\n\nchapter on national identity and what is referred to as the\n\n\u2018English question\u2019 is a proxy for immigration policy and\n\nthe party\u2019s attempts (or lack of them) to keep up with a\n\nchanging, and less homogeneous, society. Hayton explains\n\nclearly how these two long-standing issues were a double-\n\nedged sword for the party: tempting to exploit in the short\n\nterm, yet dangerous in the long term. After all:\n\n(i)n one sense, it would have been perverse for the Con-\n\nservatives not to campaign on Europe and immigration \u2013\n\nopinion polls suggested public support for the Conservative\n\npositions . . . However, the focus on these issues reinforced\n\nthe negative image of the Conservative Party, and failed to\n\nprovide a convincing narrative about the purpose of the\n\nparty. (p. 48)\n\nIn addition to primary policy documents, Hayton makes\n\nuse of a number of personal interviews with key figures\n\nfrom the period in opposition, many of whom maintained\n\ntheir prominence, securing ministerial posts since 2010.\n\nAmong them are former party leaders such as Michael\n\nHoward and the current Home Secretary Theresa May.\n\nSolid empirical data serve to illuminate certain puzzling\n\nstances that the Conservatives took. For example, why\n\nsome issues the party had been associated with \u2013 to their\n\ndetriment, such as Europe \u2013 had become less toxic over\n\ntime but others had not. Howard saw the issue of Europe\n\nand the euro as having been \u2018neutralized\u2019 by Labour\u2019s\n\npledge to hold a referendum on the issue, whereas this\n\nwas not the case for immigration policy, so it seemed to\n\nmake sense to use the issue to show dividing lines between\n\nthe parties.\n\nThe text focuses on the Conservative Party largely\n\nthrough the actions of significant actors \u2013 including politi-\n\ncians and policymakers. It considers the impact of their\n\n\u2018actions, perceptions and strategies\u2019 as they sought to get\n\na grip on the Party\u2019s repeated electoral failures at a national\n\nand local level during this period. There is a clear focus on\n\nthe impact of different party leaders with regard to their\n\npreferred issues, their understanding of the party\u2019s poor\n\nimage and how they tried to wrestle with competing elec-\n\ntoral pressures. It is a nuanced look that is charitable\n\ntowards the leaders of the Party between 1997 and 2005;\n\nthey were not as inept and misguided as popular opinion\n\nmight suggest. In fact, as Hayton states, the leaders were, to\n\nsome extent, successful, in gradually building the party up\n\ninto a (nearly) election-winning machine once again.\n\nHayton argues that Hague is to be thanked for \u2018renewing\n\nthe party organisation and reducing internal tensions\n\nover Europe\u2019 (p. 8), whilst Duncan Smith played a role in\n\n\u2018renewing policy\u2019 (p. 8), and Howard went some way\n\ntowards bringing the party together. It is a pity, perhaps,\n\nthat there is little attempt to focus on the party beyond the\n\nelite level, though understandable, given constraints of\n\nspace. Future work that looks at the party at the level of\n\nactivists, or even, ordinary party members, during this\n\nperiod would be a valuable companion to this work.\n\nThe book ends with a thoughtful chapter that scruti-\n\nnizes Cameronism \u2013 or should that be \u2018Cameroonism\u2019?\n\n\u2013 with a heavy emphasis on the modernization project\n\nwith which Cameron has been associated. Much of Hay-\n\nton\u2019s text serves to give context for the emergence of\n\nCameron\u2019s particular brand of conservatism, which is\n\nregarded as a limited reconstruction, rather than a more\n\ncomprehensive break with the past. For a party that often\n\nprides itself on having little interest in ideology, Hayton\n\nskilfully argues that the \u2018intellectual uncertainty\u2019 over the\n\nfuture of conservatism contributed to the complications\n\nthat the Conservatives endured with regard to renewing\n\ntheir relevance.\n\nYunus Emre, The Emergence of Social Democracy in Turkey:\nThe Left and Transformation of the Republican People\u2019s Party in\nTurkey, London: I.

The CHP continues to be the main opposition\n\nparty under the rule of the Adalet ve Kalk\u0131nma Partisi\n\n(AKP \u2013 Justice and Development Party). While scholarship\n\nBook reviews 421\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1177%2F1354068816636967&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2016-05-02\n\n\non the AKP has been enormous, systematic studies of the\n\nCHP have been sparse despite the latter\u2019s centrality to\n\nTurkish electoral democracy that goes back to 1950. In this\n\nregard, Yunus Emre\u2019s The Emergence of Social Democracy\n\nin Turkey, analyzing the CHP\u2019s ideological transformation\n\nin the 1960s, is a welcome addition.\n\nEmre seeks to answer the question of the causes of the\n\nideological transformation of the CHP from the party of the\n\nRepublican establishment into a social democratic force in\n\nthe mid-1960s. With the 18th Congress of the CHP in\n\nOctober 1966, \u2018the left of the centre\u2019 became the party\u2019s\n\nofficial platform. The 1960 military intervention heralded a\n\nnew era of political pluralism in Turkey and led to the 1961\n\nConstitution that had strong liberal and pluralistic charac-\n\nteristics. The CHP was heavily involved in the new consti-\n\ntutional order and formed a series of coalition governments\n\nafter the 1961 elections. At the same time, the CHP\u2019s elec-\n\ntoral support eroded throughout the 1960s. Its vote share\n\ndeclined from 37% in the 1961 parliamentary elections to\n\n27% in 1969. As the nascent socialist movement gained\n\npopularity among the Turkish intelligentsia, the centre-\n\nright Adalet Partisi (AP \u2013 Justice Party), with its strong\n\nanti-communist platform, emerged as the hegemonic elec-\n\ntoral party in the second half of the decade.\n\nIn this historical context, Emre argues that \u2018(t)he emer-\n\ngence of a strong socialist movement became the main\n\nreason for the RPP\u2019s shift to the left of the centre\u2019\n\n(p. 227). He identifies four socialist actors: contentious\n\nlabour mobilization that facilitated the enactment of rela-\n\ntively progressive labour laws in 1963, the Tu\u0308rkiye _I s\u0327c\u0327i\n\nPartisi (T_IP \u2013 Turkish Workers Party) that won 14 seats\n\nin the 1965 parliamentary elections, the illegal and clandes-\n\ntine Tu\u0308rkiye Komu\u0308nist Partisi (TKP \u2013 Turkish Communist\n\nParty) and the influential Yo\u0308n magazine published between\n\n1961 and 1967. Drawing on a rich variety of primary\n\nsources, Emre suggests that the CHP developed its left of\n\nthe centre platform both to distinguish itself from these\n\nsocialist actors and to reinvent itself as a progressive force\n\nof political change. He meticulously studies the CHP and\n\nother political actors\u2019 positions on three issues to describe\n\nits increasing commitment to social democracy: land\n\nreform linked to agricultural equality and productivity,\n\nanti-Americanism associated with a nationalist foreign\n\npolicy and planned developmentalism that aimed to\n\nachieve rapid economic growth with state guidance. His\n\nargument that the rise of social democracy was a function\n\nof these broader social and political developments is gen-\n\nerally compelling and scholars of Turkish politics will ben-\n\nefit from Emre\u2019s in-depth analysis of the CHP\u2019s internal\n\ndynamics and its relations with the broader political forces\n\nin this period.\n\nThe book has four major shortcomings. First, it lacks a\n\nwell-articulated comparative perspective that would enrich\n\nthe discussion of social democracy in Turkey. Whilst the\n\nfirst chapter offers a historical overview of the evolution of\n\nsocial democracy in Europe, it fails to inform the subse-\n\nquent chapters on Turkey in a meaningful way. The rise of\n\nsocial democracy as a political force in modern Turkey has\n\nvery different roots than in Europe, given the CHP\u2019s\n\nauthoritarian origins, the weakness of the working class\n\nand Turkey\u2019s position as a developing country. A more\n\nstimulating and interesting comparison would be with the\n\nLatin American countries with robust socialist and social\n\ndemocratic movements.\n\nSecond, the book does not engage with the scholarly\n\nliterature on party change that leaves its theoretical obser-\n\nvations about the reorientation of the CHP in the mid-1960s\n\nunder-developed. In particular, a discussion of the scholar-\n\nship on the interaction between mainstream and niche par-\n\nties would be useful, given Emre\u2019s argument that the\n\nideological transformation of the CHP, a mainstream party,\n\nwas decisively influenced by the rise of the T_IP, a niche\n\nparty. Such a theoretical move would also increase the\n\nrelevance of the book to scholars beyond experts of Turkish\n\npolitics.\n\nThird, the book does not offer any analysis of shifts in\n\nelectoral support for the CHP. It would be highly instruc-\n\ntive to explore how the CHP performed at province and\n\ndistrict level in the four elections from 1961 to 1973. Such\n\nan electoral analysis would provide valuable insights about\n\nnot only the electoral dynamics of the CHP\u2019s ideological\n\ntransformation into a force of social democracy but also the\n\nscope of the appeal of the left of the centre platform among\n\ndifferent groups of voters (e.g. urban vs. rural, Western vs.\n\nEastern, etc.). In the absence of such an analysis of\n\nelectoral cleavages, the CHP\u2019s social democratic turn is\n\npuzzling in the light of its electoral defeats in the 1965 and\n\n1969 elections.\n\nFinally, the book would be more insightful with a more\n\nextensive discussion of the CHP\u2019s trajectory since the mid-\n\n1960s. Emre rightfully notes that the CHP oscillates\n\nbetween authoritarian state-led modernization and social\n\ndemocracy. Whilst the CHP\u2019s pursuit of social democratic\n\nplatforms resulted in its electoral victories in the 1970s, it\n\nfailed to achieve similar performances in the last four\n\ndecades. Yet Emre does not provide an explanation of the\n\nfailure of the CHP to carry the mantle of social democracy\n\nin Turkey in contemporary times. The question of the CHP\n\nas a progressive and popular force remains central to the\n\nquestion of Turkish democratization, as the AKP leader\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdog\u0306an, elected president in August 2014,\n\nincreasingly monopolizes political powers in his hands and\n\naims to replace the parliamentary system with a presiden-\n\ntial one.\n\nOverall, The Emergence of Social Democracy in Turkey\n\noffers a well-researched study of the revitalization of\n\n422 Party Politics 22(3)\n\n\n\nthe founding party of the Turkish Republic as a social\n\ndemocratic force in the 1960s.

Both tasks are a daunting undertaking, which\n\ntogether pose a significant challenge for the author.\n\nImpressively, this challenge is met quite successfully. As\n\nsuch, this book should become a staple for all those inter-\n\nested in party politics.\n\nThe central argument of this book is that the electoral\n\nsystem alone cannot explain when sectarian parties will\n\nemerge to represent a new social group and if they will\n\nbe successful. In line with its title, the book attempts to\n\nexplain how social heterogeneity shapes the number of\n\nparties. This is done in an extremely well thought-out\n\nmanner, building block-by-block a sound argument that\n\nscholars will have to either take into account or attempt\n\nto refute.\n\nStoll begins with a masterful presentation of the diverse\n\nliterature relating social heterogeneity to party system frag-\n\nmentation and then raises her own theoretical perspective.\n\nShe asks if all new social groups will obtain representation\n\nvia a sectarian party if the electoral system is favorable, or\n\nvice versa if it is restrictive, and replies in the negative.\n\nThere is a positive relationship between social heterogene-\n\nity and the number of political parties, but not all new\n\ngroups will create their own party, and of these not all will\n\nsucceed. Which new groups are likely to succeed\u2014that is,\n\nwhen does an increase in social heterogeneity leads to party\n\nsystem fragmentation\u2014is the thrust of her book. Stoll iden-\n\ntifies seven factors, in addition to the electoral system, that\n\ncondition the effect of social heterogeneity on party system\n\nfragmentation. Some factors are characteristics of the\n\nsocial group itself, such as the group\u2019s politicization and\n\nsize, while others are systemic characteristics of the polity,\n\nsuch as the regime type and existing party strategy. In short,\n\nStoll counters the existing literature\u2019s rather narrow focus\n\non the electoral system as the sole, or dominant, factor\n\nconditioning the relationship between social heterogeneity\n\nand the number of political parties\u2014such predictions are\n\nlikely to be in error\u2014and argues for a broader socio-\n\ninstitutional theory.\n\nThe new theoretical argument is subjected to two\n\nlevels of empirical scrutiny. The first is based on\n\ncross-national longitudinal quantitative analyses of the\n\nrelationship between social heterogeneity and the party\n\nsystem, for which Stoll delineates a new cross-sectional\n\nindex. This is then followed by two qualitative case\n\nstudies: (immigration to) Israel and (African American\n\nenfranchisement in) the United States. The choice of\n\nthese two cases is to be applauded, since they are two\n\nof the most institutionally different democracies in exis-\n\ntence; the former serves as the \u2018\u2018crucial\u2019\u2019 case while the\n\nlatter is the least likely case for testing the hypotheses in\n\nthis book. The mixing of both quantitative and qualita-\n\ntive methods allows Stoll to validate her argument in a\n\nsignificantly better manner than any one method could\n\nhave achieved.\n\nThere are, of course, some drawbacks in this book.\n\nSome of the chapters are a bit difficult to read since the\n\nfootnotes are as lengthy as the text itself, without real\n\njustification. There are also some empirical errors, such\n\nas in her coverage of Israeli elections from 1949 to 2009,\n\nbut they are minimized by Stoll\u2019s ability to comprehend a\n\ncomplex and developing political constellation in a way\n\nthat enlightened me more than once\u2014and she correctly\n\nconcludes that regime change in Israel in the mid-1990s\n\nis the primary explanatory factor for fragmentation. She\n\nalso surprisingly suggests that when existing parties adopt\n\neither an adversarial or a partially accommodative strategy\n\ntoward the new social group both can be dangerous, since\n\nthe better strategy to head off the entry and success of a\n\nnew social group is to be fully accommodative. Both of\n\nthese findings, concerning regime type and existing party\n\nstrategy, were also supported in her case study of the\n\nUnited States.\n\nDemocratic societies change over time, largely due to\n\nprocesses such as immigration and changes in the fran-\n\nchise, among other reasons. Adding new groups of citizens\n\nwill make democracies more heterogeneous, but only some\n\nwill also reshape the party system. With Stoll\u2019s book, we\n\ncan now say more about which groups will manage to form\n\ntheir own parties and which of these will succeed. There are\n\nseveral systemic factors, beyond the electoral system, com-\n\nbined with those of the new social group itself that deter-\n\nmine the likelihood that these groups will change the party\n\nBook reviews 423\n\n\n"}
