This small Sahelian population has \nbeen challenged by declining natural resources and an \nopening up to the outside world. Temporary migration \nof families before each rainy season or harvest has \nalways been part of this population\u2019s adaptation to an \narid environment, but youth mobility, especially among \ngirls, is new. Although migration is short term and over \nrelatively short distances, it is an increasingly prevalent \nalternative to agricultural subsistence strategies. \nWhereas economic reasons underpin boys\u2019 mobility, \nfor young unmarried girls, the predominant driving \nforce is the discovery of the outside world. Broadly \nspeaking, youth migration in this population is one part \nof changing intergenerational and gender relations and \nis especially related to youths\u2019 more individual choices \nof spouse.\n\nKeywords: youth mobility; girls\u2019 mobility; temporary \nmigration; Mali; livelihood diversification; \nintergenerational relations\n\nThe Sahelian populations have developed \nimpressive capacities to cope with recur-\n\nrent droughts. However, the current combina-\ntion of population growth, increased aridity, \nand negative impacts of economic policies has \nmade alternatives to agriculture more and \nmore necessary. There has thus been a general \ntrend toward livelihood diversification, but the \nresponse of households is specific to each situ-\nation and context (Batterbury 2007). Different \ntypes of new activities have developed, due to \nthe varying opportunities of the broader con-\ntext (e.g., access to urban centers; labor market \n\nClaudine Sauvain-Dugerdil is a professor of social \ndemography. She has done fieldwork in Switzerland, \nMali, and Central America. Her research focuses on \nfamily and fertility, life course transitions, time use, and \npopulation and development; she employs mixed meth-\nods strategies designed to identify inequalities in well-\nbeing, particularly between genders.\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1177%2F0002716213485352&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2013-05-24\n\n\nYOUTH MOBILITY IN AN ISOLATED SAHELIAN POPULATION Of MALI 161\n\nopportunities). Mobility has become a key strategy to reduce vulnerability and \nincrease resilience (Tacoli 2009). Studies in Mali and Burkina faso show that \nshort-distance, temporary moves increase during droughts, whereas migration to \nurban centers and abroad is found during years with normal rainfall and among \nthe better off (findley 1994; Henry, Schoumaker, and Beauchemin 2004). Thus, \nrather short-distance and circular migrations may become an increasingly impor-\ntant element of adaptation to change, including climatic change (Tacoli 2009). \nEconomic transformations and the increased mobility of young people are con-\ncomitant with processes of modernization and individualization (Marie 1997), \nwhich are profoundly transforming familial behavior in sub-Saharan Africa (Pilon \nand Vignikin 1996). As shown by Toulmin (1992),1 the rise of individual projects \namong family members makes extended families more fragile and challenges \ntheir capacity to use their resources as well as or better than smaller households \n(Lloyd 1999). Parents\u2019 release of control over choices of spouse and more auto- \nnomy granted to youths tend to make the married couple into a private unit \n(Locoh 1995; Locoh and Mouvagha Sow 2005; Hertrich 2007), and the fragiliza-\ntion of family models in a context of increased precariousness contribute to the \nweakening of intergenerational solidarities (Locoh 1995).\n\nWe analyze the mobility habits of young people in a small Sahelian population \nin Mali that is witnessing a brutal transition from a cohesive social system and a \nself-sufficient economy to integration into the outside world in a context of \nextreme cultural and environmental precariousness. Our aim is to discover \nwhether youth migration enables the population to adapt to economic and social \nchallenges or if it precipitates the disintegration of a society already weakened by \ndecreasing natural resources and the spread of new family and cultural values \n(what Sauvain-Dugerdil and Preiswerk [1993] would call \u201cmigration-structure\u201d \nor \u201cmigration-rupture\u201d). We examine what distinguishes the new, temporary, \nmore individualistic migration of very young people from the role that mobility \nplayed previously. Is their reason to migrate clearly economic? Does their tem-\nporary migration have an impact on family subsistence or their own well-being? \nWhat is the impact of migration on intergenerational and gender relationships?\n\nData and Methods\n\nOur study focuses on four villages2 of the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 Dogon (about 2,500 persons \nin 2010). Our work in the region dates back to the mid-1970s, and is what has \nbeen described as a comprehensive demography (Bozon 2006; Petit 2008), rely-\ning on mixed survey methods.3\n\nThis study presents qualitative research on the changing behavior of young \npeople in rural areas and is a result of a partnership between the Universities of \nGeneva and Bamako developed in 2000. The rural fieldwork took place in 2002, \n2004, and annually from 2006 until 2010. Special emphasis is put on the emic \nviewpoint, that is, the meanings that villagers give themselves through interviews \nand participant observation. The information used in the present article relies on \n\n\n\n162 THE ANNALS Of THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nninety-six interviews conducted in this eight-year time span (2002\u20132010) with \nsmall groups of women and men, youths and adults.4 The interviews mainly \nfocused on youth migration and its impacts. Specific topics were added on family \nnetwork (in 2007), choice of spouse and subsistence strategies (2008), and socio-\neconomic inequalities (2009).5 Interviews took place in the local language\u2014\nTorotegu, a Dogon dialect\u2014were translated into french by a local translator, and \nwere transcribed by the researcher(s).6\n\nThe analysis has adopted an inductive approach in line with what is known as \ngrounded theory (Glaser and Straus 1967), conceived as a \u201ccircular interaction\u201d \nbetween the description of the discourse and the building up and verification of \ninterpretative keys (Guillemette 2006). We used the program Atlas-Ti to elabo-\nrate the interpretative model through the usual steps of open and axial coding, \nthat is, identification of main concepts that structured the discourse and the \nconcepts\u2019 logical links.7\n\nThe construction of the explanatory model relies on a comparative process of \nthe discourses, put in perspective with other types of information from the field \nand from the literature. Validation of the results is reached through \u201csaturation,\u201d \nwhen all information converges to give a coherent image. The qualitative data are \ncomplemented by more factual information. A questionnaire given in 2002 to a \nsmall sample of 200 young people has provided detailed retrospective informa-\ntion on youth mobility. On each subsequent field mission, we carried out a count \nof the number of young migrants by village in that specific year. The interpreta-\ntive work also relies on participant observation and the overall knowledge of the \nlong-term dynamics of the population since our first studies in the 1970s.\n\nThe Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 Population: A Story  \nof Survival in a Harsh Environment\n\nBaro and Batterbury\u2019s (2005) case studies in Niger and in Koro, a Malian Dogon \nmunicipality southeast of the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9, show that the Sahelian populations have \nan impressive capacity to cope with their harsh environment by diversifying their \nlivelihood strategies, yet this diversification brings with it changes to the social \nsystem. The Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 is in many regards an extreme case of diversification. It \nprovides a well-documented example of survival through the extensive exploita-\ntion of natural resources. The cost of this diversification, however, has been very \nhigh; the population has been marked by mortality crises (in some cases, the \ndisappearance of entire lineages), and in- and out-migration of families and even \nentire villages (Sauvain-Dugerdil 1980; Gallay and Sauvain-Dugerdil 1981). The \npopulation in the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 mountains has managed to survive, but child mortality \nwas so high that the population barely reached the reproduction level.8 In the \nmid-1970s, child mortality was as high\u2014infant mortality was 282 percent per \nthousand and the probability of surviving to five years old was 0.50\u2014as during \nperiods of epidemics in other areas (Hill 1985). This mountain population \nremained particularly marginalized until very recently, even in comparison to \n\n\n\nYOUTH MOBILITY IN AN ISOLATED SAHELIAN POPULATION Of MALI 163\n\nother villages that spoke the same variety of the Dogon language. They were \nfound to exploit and consume a wider range of wild resources than in other vil-\nlages, and had a higher fertility rate (8.3 children among women older than 40). \nThe latter had been interpreted as a result of the near-absence of temporary \nmigration, which was already spreading in other Dogon villages in the same area \nin the early 1980s (Cazes et al 1993).\n\nSimilar to the Dogon in general (Petit 1997; Thibaut 2005), mobility has been \nan integral part of the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 peoples\u2019 history and their adaptive strategies \n(Sauvain-Dugerdil 1980; Sauvain-Dugerdil, Dougnon, and Diop 2008). families \nor even entire villages have adapted to the limited water resources by moving \ntemporarily. When the strategic advantage of living in the mountains decreased \nand more peaceful relations with neighboring populations developed, the \nSarny\u00e9r\u00e9 gradually moved to the mountain foot: by 1989 the last families had left \nthe slopes. In the last decade, they increasingly colonized the lowlands.\n\nYouth Migration, Livelihood Diversification,  \nand the Path to Modernity\n\nAs a result of a decrease in natural resources and new outside influences, the \nSarny\u00e9r\u00e9 economy has gradually shifted from one that maximizes local natural \nresources to one in which livelihoods are diversified. In line with what has been \ndescribed elsewhere (Batterbury 2007), this shift was a result of both the devel-\nopment of the agro-pastoral system and the implementation of new subsistence \nstrategies that have brought with them capitalism and economic inequalities \namong families. Commercial contacts with the outside world have increased, and \ntemporary migration of young people has become a source of monetary resources. \nSince the 1990s, individual temporary migration has rapidly spread. Mobility is a \npillar of family subsistence strategies for the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9, but it is also the expression \nof deep sociocultural changes associated with the individualization that often \ncomes with modernization.\n\nWe examine the spread of this new mobility through statements from young \npeople about their overall experience and its positive and negative outcomes. We \nalso analyze the broader impact of this new mobility on the economy and family \nbehavior.\n\n\u201cExodus\u201d: The Revolution of Youth Mobility\n\nThe \u201cexodus\u201d trend\n\nThe temporary migration of young people\u2014locally called \u201cexodus\u201d\u2014should \nbe distinguished from long-term national or international migration, which \nremain very rare and usually concentrated within a few families (see figure 1). \nExodus has spread during the last decade. In 2002, among the 128 young people \n\n\n\n164 THE ANNALS Of THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nsurveyed in the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 villages, 60 percent had neither migrated nor left their \nvillage the week before (three-fourths among girls), and the proportion was half \nthat in the two other Dogon villages visited in the area. from the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9, only \n13 percent had experienced more than one migratory episode (38 percent in the \nother villages). five years later, a poll among ninety-one young people indicated \nan important progression in the phenomenon of exodus, especially among very \nyoung single girls: 94 percent of these girls (aged 17 and younger)9 and 80 \npercent of boys (aged 20 and younger) reported that they had left the village the \nweek before, and 72 percent and 58 percent, respectively, had been on at least \none exodus.\n\nIn 2006, for the first time in the history of the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 villages, without \ninforming anybody, a group of six girls, aged 14\u201315, walked some 12 miles to \nreach a road; they paid for transportation with their modest jewels and traveled \nto Mopti, Mali\u2019s third largest town, some 155 miles away. In Mopti, they helped \nsell goods in the market; they then found work as domestic servants. After 10 days, \none of the girls\u2019 fathers arrived to take them home.\n\nfIGURE 1\nYouth Migration\n\ninfluence\n\nis associated with\n\nis part of\n\nis part of\ninfluence\n\nis part of\n\nis associated with\n\nis cause of\nis associated with\n\nis associated with\ndifferent\n\nexod benefits\n\nexod means\n\nexod family\nstrategies\n\nexod parents'\nattitude\n\nexod problems\n\nexod trend\n\nexod reasons\n\nlong term migrant\n\nNOTE: Network view. Analysis of ninety-six interviews carried out between 2002 and 2012. \n\u201cExodus\u201d is expressed in the discourses through eight conceptual categories (codes). The \nanalysis of the discourses identified the reasons to go (exod reasons) and the trend during \nrecent years (exod trend) to be the most central concepts in terms of their links with each \nother. for example, the reason to go is associated with the attitude of the parents, which also \nhas indirect influence on the young persons\u2019 means and their family strategies.\n\n\n\nYOUTH MOBILITY IN AN ISOLATED SAHELIAN POPULATION Of MALI 165\n\nBy 2010, never having experienced an exodus became the rarity. Among boys, \nonly those who were in charge of caring for the herds had never left. Most girls \nhad experienced mobility. However, they do not go every year, except in one vil-\nlage where girls \u201chave taken [up] the habit [of] leaving and wish to go again.\u201d10 \nStill, very few young people, and rarely girls, stay away for as long as a couple of \nyears, and when they do, they return when it is time to marry. In short, mobility \nhas rapidly spread among this population, but its scope remains limited.\n\nParents\u2019 attitudes, and migrants\u2019 means and reasons\n\nInitially, girls\u2019 exodus was taken up without the parents\u2019 consent and even, \nanticipating their refusal, without informing them at all. They were \u201cgoing in the \nbush to gather wood or wild fruit as usual\u201d11 or to the weekly market in Boni, \nand they would leave. Along the way, they might meet a family acquaintance; \nparents, thus, would find out where they were. Parents would then commission \none of the fathers to bring them home. However, parents were aware that they \ncould not prevent their daughters from leaving. In some cases, the mother knew \nof the daughter\u2019s plan to leave and even contributed to the costs of transporta-\ntion. With the spread of this type of migration, running away has become less \nfrequent.\n\nWe were told that parents do not force their daughters to come back as much \nanymore, except if they have been away too long or if it is time to marry. Although \nmost men still disapprove of this practice for girls, they tolerate the phenomenon \nbecause it is seen as unavoidable: they \u201cwill go anyway\u201d and \u201cif they inform you, \nthis [is] a sign of respect.\u201d12 Parents accept this practice because \u201cwhen they [the \nchildren] go with the authorization of the parents, they come back with presents \nfor them.\u201d13 Large differences remain between villages, however. In the village \nmost reluctant to accept this practice of mobility, absconders are still a reality.\n\nYoung people may pay for their transportation with some earnings\u2014for boys, \nearnings from local hired work and for girls, from selling wild fruit\u2014but most of \nthe time, they do not have their own means to support their leaving. Thus, those \nwho go without their parents\u2019 permission sell goods to pay for their transport. \nGirls will sell jewelry (given to them by their parents) and boys will steal animals \nfrom the parents\u2019 herd to sell.\n\nEconomic motivation is an important reason young people (particularly boys) \nleave their village, but it is not the only reason. In 2002, slightly more than half \nof young men (52 percent) declared that they would leave to earn money, 19 \npercent said for agrarian work, and 14 percent said to compensate for a poor \nharvest. Young women leave to buy kitchen tools (57 percent) or earn money (20 \npercent). for young men, the economic objective dominates. This was expressed \nin 2004 in a young shepherd\u2019s statement; he explained that he did not need to \nleave because he could sell one of his animals to meet his individual financial \nneeds. The economic dimension is less central for girls, whose earnings potential \nremains very limited elsewhere. Their main incentive to leave, at least for the first \ntime, is to follow the example of those who have already gone and have discov-\nered the outside world.\n\n\n\n166 THE ANNALS Of THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nFamily strategy, benefits, and problems\n\nYoung people\u2019s exodus is a new phenomenon inasmuch as \u201cit is their [young \npeople\u2019s] decision\u201d14 to leave. Yet in this respect, there are important gender dif-\nferences. Girls\u2019 migration is clearly an individual project that most men consider \nuseless. \u201cWhat they bring back is not a relief for the family\u201d;15 girls\u2019 exodus \u201cdoes \nnot bring any benefit and makes them take [up] bad habits.\u201d \u201cThey become lazy \nand prefer to cook macaroni [instead of the traditional millet meal, which has an \nextensive preparation].\u201d16 It is, however, increasingly recognized, especially by \nwomen, that, although modest, girls\u2019 exodus is benefiting their parents, through \nsmall presents and items that the girls are buying on their own. More broadly, in \ntimes of scarcity, \u201cthe absence of young people allows [the family] to save food.\u201d \nYet the economic benefit of boys\u2019 migration is systematically seen by adults as \nuseful for the family. They buy personal goods that benefit all members of the \nfamily: clothes and bikes (the better-off buy motor bikes), radios, watches, hoes, \ncarts, donkeys, and even camels. However, boys often have difficulty finding \nwork outside the village or are hardly able to spare anything after paying for their \nfood and lodging and the trip home.\n\nYoung men\u2019s two main sources of work while on exodus are helping to harvest \nrice, and they are often paid for this work in goods (one to ten bales), or prepar-\ning mud bricks (earning 750\u20131,000 CfA a day, about $2 to $2.50 a day). This is \nabout twice as much as what a girl earns molding millet. In one case, a girl told \nus that she was very satisfied with her earnings\u20145,000 CfA a month (about $12). \nWhat makes a big difference for these youths financially is securing food and \nlodging; girls can obtain these through domestic work or, in a few cases, boys \nworking as gardeners can. Boys describe the work as hard and report problems \nof violence or with the police. In turn, girls testify that they have a wonderful \nexperience: domestic work is not as hard as their work at home, they are not \nexploited or subjected to violence, and they learn a lot.\n\nThe decision to leave is clearly the young person\u2019s, but it varies depending on \nthe family. Boys and girls are expected to return in time for harvest and are \nexpected to stay home until the harvest is over. Girls\u2019 decisions remain more \nindividual than boys, although they increasingly consult their parents and in some \ncases do not leave because their parents have refused to support their decision. \nBoys mentioned family reasons as reasons not to leave, such as caring for old \nparents, repairing the house, and caring for the family herd. In 2009, about one-\nthird of boys stayed in the village to finish their masonry work. Young shepherds \ndo not leave until a younger brother can take up their work.\n\nYouth Migration: One Dimension of Livelihood \nDiversification to Cope with Uncertainties\n\nIndividual exodus should also be distinguished from temporary family migration \nto cope with a bad harvest or a lack of water. All testimonies confirm that in a \n\n\n\nYOUTH MOBILITY IN AN ISOLATED SAHELIAN POPULATION Of MALI 167\n\n\u201cbad\u201d year, the entire family moves, such as was reported in early 2003. The \nwater supply remains the most limiting factor and the main determinant for \nthe location of settlements. families settled in the plain may spend weeks in the \npiedmont villages to be closer to hill ponds. Young people\u2019s exodus appears to be \nindependent of agricultural production: they leave even when there is a good \nyield and possibly more often because there is a good yield, as it is easier to \nfinance transportation. In 2010, after a harvest described as \u201cvery good,\u201d as \nmany young people left as the year before, which was qualified as \u201cnot very \ngood.\u201d\n\nYoung people\u2019s mobility is part of a broader phenomenon of the diversification \nof livelihoods, which is linked to decreasing natural resources, demographic pres-\nsures, and the entrance into a cash economy (see figure 2). Settling in the low-\nlands has given people access to larger and more fertile plots, but all testimonies \nconverged to declare that agricultural production had decreased by about one-\nthird. Natural resources have been shrinking as well. Wild game that was present \nat the time of our fieldwork in the mid-1970s is not seen anymore. The same is \ntrue for the very large number of wild plants that the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 people used to \nconsume. Women have to walk longer distances to find wild fruits. Baobab trees \nhave disappeared and cotton does not grow any more.\n\nThe former way of living\u2014intensive exploitation of all natural resources\u2014is \nnot viable anymore, and agriculture intensification alone is not enough. \nLivelihoods had to diversify and the autarchic economic system had to open to \nthe outside world and the cash economy. The abandonment of cotton growing, \nspinning, and weaving are main contributors to the need for a cash economy. \nHowever, the need for cash is also fomented by outside influences: industrial \nmaterial is preferred to the crude homemade cotton, young people are entering \nthe era of jeans and t-shirts, and traditional heavy and fragile potteries are being \nsubstituted with plastic and metal pots.\n\nIn addition, the location of the villages in the plain and the acquisition of bicy-\ncles and carts make it easier to frequent the weekly markets in surrounding \ntowns. Some young men buy basic goods in places where the prices are lower and \nstock their own small business in the village with these items. Women sell wild \nfruits or homemade baskets and other wickerwork. The shift from a purely agri-\ncultural society to an agro-pastoral system opens the door to incipient capitalism. \nAnimal breeding is the main source of cash. Crop surplus remains rare, as it \nrequires three successive good harvests.\n\nWealth is linked to the ability to diversify sources of income and therefore with \nthe size of the family\u2019s labor force. Youth mobility, then, does not bring large \nbenefits to the family, but, rather, it contributes to emerging economic inequali-\nties: the poorest ones use their earnings to meet basic needs whereas the better \noff capitalize on their earnings.

Parents worry that their children may not come back, one reason \n\u201cthey do not dare any more [to] hit their kids.\u201d Men are afraid that young women \nwill consider them \u201cdirty\u201d\u2014because they have not learned basic hygiene (mainly \nbecause of the lack of water), which is seen as being modern and urban\u2014and will \nnot marry them.\n\nModernization is expressed both through incipient individualization of fam-\nily members and increased autonomy of family units. The current youth popu-\nlation is the first generation with personal belongings: bikes, radios, watches, \nbut also their own livestock. These new possessions are powerful bridges to \nnew behaviors and values. Other Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 villages and local markets have \nbecome part of the \u201cusual\u201d territory. Contacts with neighboring communities \nhave developed beyond the former goods exchanges, the temporary stays of the \n\nfIGURE 3\nThe Sociocultural System\n\nis associated with\n\ninfluence\n\nis part of\n\nis associated withis part of\n\ninfluence\n\nis part of\n\nis part of\n\nis part of\n\ninfluence\n\nis part of\n\ninfluence\n\ninfluence\n\ntradition-chefferie\n\ndrug & tea\n\ngender\n\ngenerations\n(relation-changes)\n\nhandicraft\n\nleisure-social youth\n\nmarriage\n\npremarital\nrelationships\n\nreligionwomen work &\norganization CF:norms\n\nNOTE: Network view. Analysis of ninety-six interviews carried out between 2002 and 2012. \nThree interdependent \u201cnorms\u201d are organizing the discourse related to the sociocultural sys-\ntem: customs based on the power of traditional leaders (chefferie), new religious fundamental-\nism, and the gender and generation systems. Marriage remains a central social institution.\n\n\n\n170 THE ANNALS Of THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nblacksmith, and sporadic visits of merchants or marabous. Tea drinking and \nWestern-style clothing are more than just new goods; they imply a change in \nlifestyle.\n\nMoving into the lowlands has also been described as a way to become inde-\npendent from the traditional leaders, and the scattered households re-enforce \neach family\u2019s autonomy. Traditional leadership is losing power, but new conserva-\ntisms are emerging. Radical Islam is replacing the prevailing long-term traditions \nbut is having little influence on everyday life in the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 villages, which are \nknown for their witchcraft. Thus, currently, there is complex syncretism and a \nmix of tradition and modernity.\n\nThe new Islamic discourse forbids tam-tam playing and dancing, which are \nconsidered amoral in Islam. The traditional bell dance has lost its ceremonial \nmeaning as a way to communicate with the local spirits and as an occasion for \nyoung people to meet. The new Islamic principles also recommend that women \nstay home. Women, therefore, stopped working in their husband\u2019s field and dedi-\ncated more time to their own crop. What could be seen as an improvement in \nwomen\u2019s autonomy has turned into increasing women\u2019s responsibilities in provid-\ning for the family\u2019s sustenance. Rather than providing food for their families from \ntheir crops, then, men increasingly use the cash from sales of their crop to buy \nlivestock, for example (Sauvain-Dugerdil et al. 2008).\n\nGirls\u2019 exodus is tolerated by the society as long as it does not challenge mar-\nriage, that is, as long as the girls accept their chosen husband and return for the \nmarriage. A woman must move into the husband\u2019s house after marrying; however, \nif the union is not a good match, she may return to her parents\u2019 home. If she \nreturns home, she is free to choose a new husband. This practice is not new, but \nthe number of young women who \u201cdo not sit down\u201d at their husbands\u2019 is increas-\ning. Premarital sex is not an accepted practice. Yet young people do have pre-\nmarital sex but not with a future spouse. When premarital pregnancy occurs, \nmarriage is postponed until after the birth. In most instances, the child remains \nwith the mother\u2019s family, but sometimes he or she lives with the mother at her \nhusband\u2019s home.\n\nExodus does not seem to challenge the social order, yet indices show that it \nmay be generating dramatic changes in marriage practices and childbearing. A \nyoung person\u2019s chosen spouse is increasingly questioned. Young men wish to \nbe consulted about the choice of spouse, and more and more often parents \nconfirm their son\u2019s choice rather than impose their own. Girls\u2019 refusals of the \nchosen husband, especially when much older, are more frequent. Exodus, in \nsome instances, then, has become a way to reject planned marriage. Moreover, \nindividual exodus appears to have spread among married women, who often \nleave without informing their husbands. The few cases of exodus of new moth-\ners who leave their child behind are looked down on, whereas those of young \nmarried women not yet mothers seem to be more or less tolerated. However, \nelders mentioned in 2004 their fear that this new habit would delay the arrival \nof the first child: \u201cWhen a married woman do[es] not move, she will have a \nchild rapidly and the family will be wealthy. It is more important to have chil-\ndren than earn money.\u201d In our data from the 2002 survey, such an effect could \n\n\n\nYOUTH MOBILITY IN AN ISOLATED SAHELIAN POPULATION Of MALI 171\n\nnot be seen: the distribution of age at first birth was identical among those who \nhad migrated and those who never had (Sauvain-Dugerdil et al. 2008). Yet \nthere appears to be a slight postponement of the first child among younger \ncohorts: 74 percent of those younger than 17 had not yet had a child, whereas \nthe figure was 60 percent among those aged 17 to 20 (Sauvain-Dugerdil et al. \n2008).\n\nDiscussion\n\nSince the first cases in the late 1990s, temporary migrations of very young \nSarny\u00e9r\u00e9 people, especially girls, have rapidly spread. What was still a new behav-\nior at the time of our first interviews in 2002 has now become the norm, a new \nkind of threshold along the path of the transition to adulthood. However, the \nscope of exodus remains relatively limited in its frequency, duration, and eco-\nnomic benefits. Young people do not go every year, and only in very specific cases \ndo they refuse to return home for agricultural work or marriage. Such cases exist \nin the villages with more outside contact, and villages differ in the frequency of \nthe exodus and in the degree of adult agreement about it.\n\nAlthough modest, the economic benefit of exodus is worthwhile in this context \nof extreme destitution. It is part of the process of livelihood diversification, nec-\nessary to cope with increasing pressures from declining natural resources. \nMoreover, the economic meaning of exodus has a strong gender dimension. \nYoung men\u2019s decision to migrate relies on an economic rationale and is often \ndescribed by young men as a financial obligation. Although they increasingly give \npriority to obtaining personal goods while on exodus, they also contribute to fam-\nily needs. Their bikes become a means of transportation for the whole family, and \nthey acquire goods useful for agricultural work. Their exodus is an individual \ndecision, but it is closely tied to the family. Therefore, the whole community sees \nit as useful.\n\nThe economic dimension appears less obvious for females\u2019 exodus. The main \nreason they leave is to discover the outside world rather than to meet material \nneeds. Exodus has spread among girls as the wish to know what the pioneers\u2014\nthose most in contact with the outside\u2014had experienced. Their earnings are \nsmaller and their stay is usually shorter than boys\u2019. Moreover, the goods they \nbring back are not seen as useful, because they concern the \u201cfemale\u201d realm, for \nexample, kitchen tools. The young women we spoke to never expressed exodus \nas an economic obligation. Often, after having left the first time without inform-\ning their parents, they wish to go again but with parental consent. They do not \nleave every year and usually not after getting married. Exodus opens up for them \na completely new period of increased autonomy, described by the fact that they \nbecame more awake (\u00e9veill\u00e9es), but their everyday lives do not seem to change \nmuch: \u201cafter a few days [after their return], they behave as before.\u201d When they \nreturn, they do not spend time drinking tea or smoking cigarettes like young \nmen; they do not have new belongings, such as a bike.\n\n\n\n172 THE ANNALS Of THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nTemporary exodus among young people in these Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 villages is part of a \nglobal trend toward modernization, characterized by giving up traditional cloth-\ning and handicraft and, most of all, by a fundamental shift toward individualiza-\ntion. Exodus affects intergenerational relationships and questions traditional \npower systems and social institutions, such as the established rules of marriage. \nAt the same time, conservative religious influences are infiltrating some sectors \nof the population and are affecting the value system, especially the gender sys-\ntem. In these societies, women have always enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. \nWomen have apparently gained more economic weight and decision power. Men \ncomplain about the increasing role of women in family decisions, particularly \nabout mothers\u2019 connivance with girls\u2019 exodus. But most of all, women\u2019s responsi-\nbility for the family\u2019s well-being has increased, for example, with the new respon-\nsibility due to decreasing natural resources (Tacoli 2009).\n\nAt this point in time, youth mobility appears to be more a \u201cmigration struc-\nture\u201d than a \u201cmigration rupture.\u201d It offers a new opportunity for this remote \npopulation to cope with economic uncertainties and to negotiate the transition \nto modernity. Yet the central issue remains whether mobility empowers the \nyoung people without provoking social disintegration. There is a delicate redis-\ntribution of power taking place within the society, but real generational conflicts \nseem to be avoided thanks to the realism of elders toward the fact that \u201ctime is \nchanging.\u201d Another issue is whether exodus will help women to face their grow-\ning responsibilities in a context of pressures from new traditional Islamic \nvalues.\n\nThere are signs that girls\u2019 exodus is increasingly becoming economic in moti-\nvation. In one village, they now go on exodus every year, and they apparently have \nstarted to take part in the commercial sex trade. During our last interview in \n2010, one elder acknowledged that sex during exodus is much more frequent \nthan admitted, as are premarital pregnancies (three recent cases in their village). \nThere is a new trend of commercial sex with unskilled migrant laborers, which \nhas provided girls with an easier way to get more financial benefits from their \nmigration. Such emerging issues have to be further considered. More broadly, \nfuture research should examine whether this new window to the world will make \nyoung men and women able and willing to continue to make their living in their \nhome population, or whether exodus will become a factor of social disintegration \nand the path to more definite emigration.\n\nNotes\n\n1. She is referring to a Bambara village, Kala, in the region of Segou (Mali).\n2. for reasons of confidentiality, the names of the villages are not given.\n3. first, we pursued an objective micro-evolution of these isolated populations, which aimed to recon-\n\nstruct long-term population dynamics through the collection of oral history (long-term genealogies and \nmobility history), participatory observation of the socioeconomic and cultural systems, and archeological \nsurveys of all former sites on the mountains. This objective micro-evolution also analyzed differentials in \nfertility and infant mortality through female genesic histories (Sauvain-Dugerdil 1980; Gallay and Sauvain-\nDugerdil 1981; Cazes et al. 1993).\n\n\n\nYOUTH MOBILITY IN AN ISOLATED SAHELIAN POPULATION Of MALI 173\n\n4. In the difficult field conditions, small groups of three to five persons appeared to be, especially for \nfemales, the best way to minimize problems of translation and increase respondents\u2019 confidence. Thus, our \ndata face the same limitations as that from focus groups; that is, we did not collect individual opinions but \nthe perceptions of the group as a whole.\n\n5. The information has been collected by the author, in 2006 and 2008 with one assistant each year \nworking with the LaboD\u00e9mo (E. Marsicano and X. Melo), and in 2007 with the project team (M. Kir\u00e9, B. \nGakou, Cheick B. Diallo for the Malian side; and A. W. Dieng and E. Roulin for the Swiss side). Allan G. \nHill took part to the 2009 field mission.\n\n6. Translation was an important obstacle; however, we were able to get the overall meaning. It was only \nfor the two last field missions that we were able to find a man from a nearby town who knew both Torotegu \nand french. In turn, during the earlier missions, the translator was a Poular speaker, a language spoken by \nmost men but not women, so a second translator was necessary.\n\n7. Inductive work requires an important investment from the researcher whose role is to scroll the \ndiscourses to identify the main concepts (open coding). The content of the quotes associated with each \ncode throughout the material collected is analyzed from a comparative perspective, that is, to detect coher-\nence and incoherence, as much within as between individual discourses. The final step is to infer the \nlogical relationships linking the various codes. The outcome of this so-called axial coding can be visualized \nthrough a network view that highlights the relative centrality of the codes (through the density of their \nlinks with other codes) and structures them in subgroups (see figures 1 to 3). The identification and \nanalysis of concepts have to be distinguished from statistics on word counting, which relies on a controver-\nsial assumption that the wording is a reliable proxy to capture the meaning of the discourse. This is espe-\ncially true in our field conditions.\n\n8. During the nine generations covered by the genealogies, only 2.5 children reached adult age, and \nonly two contributed to the next generation, that is, got married and had children. \n\n9.
