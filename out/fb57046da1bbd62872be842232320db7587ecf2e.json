Around 3%\nof Scotland's population are aged 16 or 17 and the Referendum\nwas the \u2018first time that people of that age [took] part in amajor pub-\nlic ballot in Scotland\u2019 (Eichorn, 2013: 3). This therefore seems an\nappropriate time to (re)consider the place of young people in poli-\ntics and in political geography.\n\nFor over ten years now, a small group of scholars have been\nemphasising the ways in which young people are a part of, rather\nthan apart from, politics and political geographies (e.g. Hopkins &\nAlexander, 2010; Kallio & H\u20acakli, 2011; Philo & Smith, 2003). This\nwork has drawn attention to a range of issues including: how young\nLatinos in Salt Lake City raise questions and reframe debates about\nthe politics of immigration (Cahill, 2010); how discourses of nation-\nalism are reinforced to young people in school classrooms in\nArgentina and the Falkland Islands (Benwell, 2014); how young\nMuslim men engage with political issues (including voting and\nformal politics) in promoting a sense of belonging in Scotland\n(Hopkins, 2007); and how young people engage with citizenship\nand democracy in the context of the \u2018Arab Awakening\u2019 in the Mid-\ndle East and North Africa in 2011 (Staeheli & Nagel, 2012). Work\nabout young people and politics now includes scholarship about\nformal politics (e.g. voting), research about activism and protest\n(e.g. Hopkins & Todd, 2015) as well as concerns about critical\ngeopolitics (e.g. Benwell & Hopkins, 2015; H\u20acorschelmann, 2008)\nand transnational citizenship (H\u20acorschelmann & El Rafaie, 2014).\nFurthermore, such issues are also generating interest amongst po-\nlitical scientists (e.g. Sloam, 2012).\n\nIn one sense then, there is plenty of work about young people,\npolitics and political geography; reminding political geographers\n(yet again), that young people are active political agents e who\nengage with and respond to political issues in awhole host of inter-\nesting and creative ways e feels rather repetitive of the key argu-\nments contained in the rich vein of scholarship that is\nsummarised above. However, the opening up of the vote to 16\nand 17 year olds provides a useful opportunity to revisit the topic\nof young people's political geographies and to consider what differ-\nence the inclusion of young people in the Referendum makes to\nScottish politics and to debates about political engagement and\nparticipation. I now reflect on the extension of the franchise in\nthe Scottish Independence Referendum to include 16 and 17 year\nolds, and raise questions about the impact of this significant polit-\nical change for how we conceive of, and understand, political\ngeography.\n\nIn early 2012, a public consultationwas launched by the Scottish\nGovernment about the Referendum (SPICe, 2013). 30,219 responses\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.12.006\n0962-6298/\u00a9 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article\nwere submitted and one of the key questions in the consultation\n(question 7) focused on the extension of the franchise to include\n16 and 17 year olds. 24,777 respondents commented specifically\non this issue, with 56% generally agreeing with the proposal. For\nthose in support of this move, they made reference to the fact\nthat young people are allowed to marry, work (and therefore pay\ntax), and join the army at 16 (and so should be entitled to vote).\nOthers who submitted a response to the consultation argued that\nyoung people should be able to vote as they are the future of Scot-\nland and some suggested that extending the franchise may\nencourage young people to become more engaged with political is-\nsues and in the political process. However, those who opposed this\nmove were suspicious that is was motivated by the Scottish Na-\ntional Party (SNP) government's view that the young were more\nlikely to vote for independence. Some queried the maturity of\nyoung people to participate in the Referendum (and suggested\nthey would be easily influenced by friends, family members and\nschool teachers). Some respondents also pointed out that 16 and\n17 year olds are not legally permitted to purchase alcohol or ciga-\nrettes, so questioned why they should be given the vote. 11 organi-\nsations that work with, or are run by, young people also responded\nand 10 of these supported the move to include 16e17 year olds. The\neleventh expressed mixed views. The SNP, Scottish Liberal Demo-\ncrats and Scottish Green Party all agreed with lowering the voting\nage to include 16 and 17 year olds (Griesbach, Robertson,\nWaterton, & Birch, 2012).\n\nThose opposed to the inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds often as-\nsume that young people are disinterested in, and disengaged from,\npolitics. However, based upon telephone survey research, Eichorn\n(2013: 1) notes that \u2018young people in Scotland do not appear to\nbe any less interested in politics than the overall population, though\nthey are much less likely to identify with a political party\u2019. An addi-\ntional concern expressed by those opposing the inclusion of 16 and\n17 year olds focused on the likelihood that young people's views\nwould be too easily shaped by their parents, teachers or peers\n(Griesbach et al., 2012). Eichorn (2014) was able to interview young\npeople in addition to consulting their parents about their voting in-\ntentions and found that 44% of the young people were planning on\nvoting differently from their parents, although parents clearly have\nsome influence in terms of political socialisation. However, this rai-\nses important e as yet unanswered questions e about the role of\nthe family, peer group and others e in shaping the political views\nand voting practices of young people. Political scientists have\nbeen debating the influence that the age profile of the electorate\nhas on the outcome of elections (e.g. Berry, 2014; Davidson,\n2014), drawing upon debates about intergenerational relations. Po-\nlitical geographers could usefully therefore engage with debates\nabout relational geographies of age and intergenerationality\nunder the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.12.006&domain=pdf\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09626298\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/polgeo\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.12.006\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.12.006\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.12.006\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.\ufffd0/\n\n\nGuest Editorial / Political Geography 46 (2015) 91e9292\n(Hopkins & Pain, 2007) and geographies of youth, education and\nthe family (e.g. Hopkins, 2010) in order to explore the multiple\nand complex influences on young people's political engagements,\nvoting intentions and electoral practices.\n\nIn order for 15 year olds who would be 16 on the day of the Ref-\nerendum to register e as they are not permitted to be included on\nthe Electoral Register e it was necessary to create a Register of\nYoung Voters. The Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise)\nBill e which included provision for the creation of this Register e\nreceived Royal Assent in 2013. Although the Scottish Independence\nReferendumwas one of the first major ballots to include 16 and 17\nyear olds, there are a number of other examples of the franchise be-\ning extended to include 16 and 17 year olds in the UK or in self-\ngoverning dependencies of the Crown. In 2006, the Isle of Man low-\nered its voting age to 16 (from 18) and in 2007 Jersey and Guernsey\ndid the same in preparation for their elections in 2008. There have\nalso been pilot Health Board elections in 2010 in Fife and in Dum-\nfries and Galloway where, for the first time in Scotland, the vote\nwas extended to 16 and 17 year olds. These changes e and the mo-\ntivations behind them e are important for political geographers to\nconsider in their work in order to comprehend the complexity of\nelectoral geographies, party politics and voting practices.\n\nI am involved in ongoing collaborative research about the\neveryday geopolitics of young people growing up in Scotland\nwho are from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds. By the\ntime of the Referendum, we had conducted focus groups and inter-\nviews with around 300 young people (aged 12e25) from across\nScotland. Although some claimed to have no interest in politics,\nthe vast majority were well-informed about the Referendum and\nwere attuned to the different arguments about the benefits and\nrisks of independence. Most young people involved in this research\nclaimed that the information they accessed about the Referendum\nwas from a range of sources including TV news programmes and\nsocial media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), as well as from family\nand friends. Schools played an important role in generating discus-\nsions about this, whether through informal discussions with peers\nor for those who selected Modern Studies, a subject in the Scottish\neducation system that focuses on contemporary political and social\nissues. This demonstrates the potential importance of both social\nmedia and educational institutions as key spaces for political geog-\nraphers to engage with in seeking to include young people in their\nanalyses of electoral geographies and political participation.\n\nIt was clear from the coverage of the Scottish Independence Ref-\nerendum thatmanypeoplee including youngpeopleeweredeeply\ninvolved in, and engaged by, thewhole process. Manywere active in\nlocal campaigning, regularly participating in debates about the Ref-\nerendum; something about the Scottish Independence Referendum\nclearly captured the imagination of the Scottish people. From the\nperspective of young people, the Referendum offered them the op-\nportunity to have a say in a major political decision, and this was\noften thefirst chance theyhad to participate in such a significant de-\ncision. The continuing austerity cuts of the UKGovernmentewhich\nare continuing to harm young people's life chances through the\nwithdrawal of funding from a variety of frontline services, educa-\ntional and employment opportunities e provided a significant, but\ndeeply unfortunate, backdrop fromwhich young people could envi-\nsion a more hopeful future; a future where they could freely access\neducational and employment opportunities and be provided with\nmuch-needed public services without the risk of further cuts.\n\nThe Scottish Independence Referendum demonstrates the ben-\nefits of opening up the vote to young people and the ways that a\npolitics of hope may be harnessed to maximise youth political\nparticipation; moreover, it highlights the different spaces in which\npolitical debate takes place e on social media, in the school class-\nroom, amongst peers and at home (see Pinkerton & Benwell,\n2014). Following the call of the Chair of the Scottish Youth Parlia-\nment, Louise Cameron, perhaps the lowering of the voting age to\n16 across the UK and elsewhere will enable young people to\nbecome fully recognised as political agents and for political geogra-\nphers to integrate consideration of age e the agency of young peo-\nple e into their work.\n\nConflict of interest\n\nNone declared.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to Matt Benwell and Gurchathen Sanghera for\ntheir constructive comments on a draft of this paper, and to Phil\nSteinberg for inviting me to write this editorial.
