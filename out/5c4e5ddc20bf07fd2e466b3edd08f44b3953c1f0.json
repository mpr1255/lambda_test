Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,\n2020. 253p. $59.95 cloth.\ndoi:10.1017/S1537592721000360\n\n\u2014 Colin Farrelly, Queen\u2019s University\nfarrelly@queensu.ca\n\nIn Your Whole Life: Beyond Childhood and Adulthood,\nJames Bernard Murphy focuses on our shared human\nidentity, something he believes is needed if we are to move\nforward toward greater tolerance, justice and harmony.\nWhat we share, contendsMurphy, is the desire to explain a\nwhole human life, what accounts for our unity over time.\nHe offers a developmental story of human nature based on\na \u201cnested hierarchy\u201d of the following three powers: \u201cFirst,\neach person\u2019s unique human genome ensures biological\nidentity over time; second, each person\u2019s powers of\nimagination and memory ensure psychological identity\nover time; third, each person\u2019s ability to tell his own life\nstory ensures narrative identity over time\u201d (p. 3).\nEarly on in the bookMurphy comments that \u201cthis book\n\nis about how we develop, not how we descended from\nprimates\u201d (p. 2). Casting aside Charles Darwin and evo-\nlutionary biology, Murphy turns instead to four basic\nstories of human development all derived before Darwin\u2019s\nbirth in the nineteenth century: these stories are advanced\nby Aristotle, Jesus of Nazareth, Augustine, and Rousseau.\nPart I of the book titled \u201cStories of Development\u201d consists\nof five chapters (approximately half the book) that canvass\nthe intellectual history of ideas concerning human devel-\nopment. Murphy emphasizes five stories of development\nfrom these historical treatments: (1) indirect development\u2014\nindirect developers develop through metamorphosis (like\na caterpillar or the discontinuity we see between children\nand adults); (2) recapitulation\u2014\u201ca handy way to organize\nthe messy complexity of evolution, history, and develop-\nment along a single hierarchy from lower to higher\u201d (p. 22);\n(3) preformationism\u2014\u201cdevelopment is merely a matter of\ngetting larger\u201d (p. 23); (4) epigenesis\u2014\u201cdevelopment is the\nprocess whereby the generic becomes the specific and\nthe outline becomes the detailed blueprint\u201d (p. 23); and\n(5) neotny\u2014which is \u201cjuvenilization\u201d and comes from the\nGreek, meaning \u201cto stretch out or prolong youthfulness\u201d\n(p. 24).\nMurphy traces the historical development of these\n\ndifferent accounts of human development in part 1,\naddressing Aristotle\u2019s ideas about teleology, Augustine\u2019s\nattempt to view the human life from God\u2019s point of view,\nRousseau\u2019s account of the transition from amour de soi to\namour propre, and Matthew\u2019s account of Jesus telling the\ndisciples to become humble like a child. The underlying\nassumption of these diverse and disparate historical accounts\nis that they converge to yield a coherent, accurate, and\nnormatively prescriptive account of human development.\n\nThis convergence is the focus of part II titled \u201cUnifying the\nWhole.\u201d A concluding chapter contains five \u201cpracticums\u201d to\nguide our life writing.\n\nThe thinkers Murphy invokes to unpack his account of\nhuman development are varied and comprehensive,\nthough also limited. His argument is anchored in\ncenturies-old philosophical and theological treatments of\nthe topic of human development. Aristotle is foundational\nto Murphy\u2019s argument: he takes Aristotle to be \u201cthe only\ngreat philosopher who was also a biologist, and his bio-\nlogical understanding of development is what makes him\nan essential guide to human life\u201d (pp. 3\u20134). I agree with\nMurphy that Aristotle is certainly a great philosopher, but\nour understanding of biology has significantly improved in\nthe last two millennia. Over just the past century, science\nhas contributed significant insights to our understanding\nof human development from childhood to adolescence to\nadulthood. Murphy notes (p. 102) that developmental\npsychologist Erik Erikson claimed that more has been\nlearned about human development in the twentieth cen-\ntury than in all of earlier history. Erikson\u2019s sentiment is one\nI share, which made me wonder why Murphy grounded\nhis analysis of human development in philosophical the-\nories and religious beliefs about human development,\nrather than these recent scientific accounts. As an intellec-\ntual history of the ideas of human development, part I of\nYour Whole Life offers an interesting account of how pre-\nscientific thinkers grappled with these ideas. But I was not\npersuaded that engaging with these historical accounts was\nthat helpful in bringing those insights together to present a\ncoherent and plausible account of human development.\n\nIn the introduction, Murphy notes that \u201cthe study of\nhuman life is intrinsically multidisciplinary\u201d (p. 4). But\nrather than ground his project in the latest empirical\nfindings concerning human development (especially\npsychology), Murphy instead advances a developmental\nstory of human nature that is based on a \u201cnested hierarchy\nof three powers.\u201d There are important psychological\naccounts of development, especially of adults, that I would\nhave liked to see Murphy engage with to test and assess his\naccount of development. For example, the research of\ndevelopmental psychologist Robert Kegan has focused\non adult development; his findings would challenge the\npremise of Murphy\u2019s account that there is a shared story of\ndevelopment. Kegan (The Evolving Self, 1982) distin-\nguishes between three stages of adult development in the\nmodern world: the social mind (we rely on authority for\nguidance), the self-authoring mind (a person is capable of\nstepping back from the socially embedded norms of the\nculture and critically assessing them), and the self-\ntransforming mind (a person is capable of invoking\nmultiple value systems at the same time and evaluating\nwhich is most suitable in any particular context). Kegan\ncontends that only a minority of the adult population\nreaches the stages of development beyond the socialized\n\n622 Perspectives on Politics\n\nBook Reviews | Political Theory\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721000360\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Kegan also contends that the self-transforming\nmind has never been reached before age 40. This theory of\ndevelopment offers an intriguing comparison with Aris-\ntotle\u2019s conjecture that we are mentally at our prime by\naround age 50. Engaging more with the science of human\ndevelopment would have, I believe, made Murphy\u2019s argu-\nments more interesting and compelling.\nOther influential psychological theories of develop-\n\nment that would be very germane to Murphy\u2019s project\ninclude John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth\u2019s research\ninto \u201cattachment theory.\u201d This is addressed, in a periph-\neral way, by Murphy when he acknowledges that our\nparents write the first several chapters of our lives and\n\u201cmany of us never escape our parental narratives\u201d\n(p. 182). An account of human development founded\non insights from attachment theory would, in my opin-\nion, have offered a more defensible and plausible account\nthan one that invokes Augustine and Jesus. Similarly,\nsignificant contributions have been made to the science\nof psychological change through \u201cstory editing\u201d by Tim-\nothy Wilson (Redirect: Changing the Stories We Live By,\n2015) and \u201cacceptance and commitment therapy\u201d by\nSteven Hayes (A Liberated Mind, 2019). Finally, Dan\nSiegal\u2019s work on interpersonal neurobiology (Mindsight,\n2010) is also very relevant to Murphy\u2019s project. All of\nthese areas of scientific research would have made for\ninteresting points of convergence and divergence with\nMurphy\u2019s account of development. By pre-committing\nthe core of his analysis to an engagement with thinkers\nwho lived before the nineteenth century, Murphy\u2019s\nargument amounts to an interesting intellectual history\n\nof ideas concerning human development rather than a\ncoherent, empirically informed, and normatively pre-\nscriptive account of human development designed to\nhelp us create more tolerant and just societies.\nIn the concluding chapter Murphy details five practi-\n\ncums in an innovative but short part of the book. The five\npracticums are (1) learning to be the editor of your life;\n(2) learning from the classics; (3) learning from biograph-\nies; (4) stories of redemption; and (5) write your own\nobituary and eulogy. Each is expanded on in only a\nparagraph or two but concisely detail the prescriptions of\nMurphy\u2019s account of development. Had these five practi-\ncums received the extensive detail and attention given to\nthe historical influences on Murphy\u2019s ideas, the coherence\nand social significance of his account of development\nwould have been amplified more effectively. These prac-\nticums\u2019 potential for promoting greater tolerance, justice,\nand harmony is not really developed in the book. The\ndetails of Murphy\u2019s account of development and narrative\nwould also have profited by addressing how specific chal-\nlenges that humans tend to face at different stages of the\nlife span\u2014such as the pressures to fit into social cliques\nduring our formative adolescence, choosing a career, issues\nrelating to marriage and family, and the stressors of illness,\nunemployment, and the death of a loved one\u2014affect (for\nbetter or worse) our powers of imagination, memory, and\nstory editing.\nThe themes and concerns of Your Whole Life are\n\nimportant and worthy of engagement. Although I may\ndisagree withMurphy about which fields of knowledge are\nmost relevant to undertaking such an interdisciplinary\nproject, he is to be commended for writing such an\ninnovative and interesting book.\n\nAMERICAN POLITICS\n\nImmigration and the American Ethos. By Morris Levy and\nMatthew Wright. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2020.\n231p. $99.99 cloth, $29.99 paper.\ndoi:10.1017/S1537592721000918\n\n\u2014 Tom K. Wong , University of California, San Diego\ntomkwong@ucsd.edu\n\nImmigration has become the defining issue of a gener-\nation. Although political scientists generally came late to\nthe study of immigration research on attitudes toward\nimmigrants and about immigration, the politics of immi-\ngration policy making, the implications of these policies,\nand immigrant incorporation, including how immigrants\nare reshaping electorates, is a thriving industry. Morris\nLevy and Matthew Wright add to our understanding of\nimmigration politics and policy in the United States by\n\nmaking a timely and important contribution to a bur-\ngeoning literature on Americans\u2019 attitudes toward immi-\ngrants and about immigration. The authors provide\ntheoretically and empirically rich analyses that take the\nliterature beyond a dichotomy that pits economic against\ncultural anxieties and threats and carves out explanatory\nspace for the role of political values, or what the authors\ndescribe as \u201ccivic fairness.\u201d Whereas the literature, par-\nticularly in recent years, has found greater empirical\nsupport for theories centered on cultural as opposed to\nthose focused on economic anxieties and threats, Levy and\nWright stir the pot by arguing that civic fairness may, in\nmany cases, outperform rival explanations in explaining\nAmericans\u2019 complex attitudes. For this reason, Immigra-\ntion and the American Ethos is a must-read.\nIn the introductory chapter, the authors begin by\n\ndescribing an empirical puzzle, writing that \u201ca great many\npeople hold seemingly divergent\u2014and often perplexing\u2014\nmixes of opinion as we move from one policy area to the next\u201d\n\nJune 2021 | Vol. 19/No. 2 623\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721000360\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.
