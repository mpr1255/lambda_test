Chinese contemporary judiciary and its reform interest more and more foreign polit-\nicians, practitioners, scholars and investors. But for a long time there had been lack of a\nbook specializing in this theme before this volume named The Judicial System and Reform\nin Post-Mao China written by Yuwen Li was published the year before last. The author,\nwho was educated and worked in Peking University and now is a professor and the dir-\nector of the China Law Centre of Law School of Erasmus University Rotterdam, reviews\nand discusses the judicial system and reform in post-Mao China in an objective, compre-\nhensive and comparative approach.\n\n2. This volume begins with \u201cIntroduction\u201d which traces back the history of China\u2019s ju-\ndicial system and presents the structure of the book. The author also demonstrates her\nmethodology applied in this book which combines traditional modes of legal analysis\nwith case studies and empirical research.\n\n3. Named \u201cJurisdiction, Hierarchy and Actors\u201d, Chapter 1 deals with the jurisdiction\nof the courts and the relationship between higher and lower courts. The author carefully\nuncovers the maze of the jurisdiction of the courts in China which is classified into juris-\ndiction by levels, territorial jurisdiction, transferred or designated jurisdiction as well as\njurisdiction over foreign-related cases. To reveal the relationship between higher and\nlower courts, the author analyses the remand for re-trial system and the system of re-\nopening a trial or request for instruction. People\u2019s assessors and adjudication committee\nare also discussed in depth in this chapter.\n\n4. Chapter 2 focuses on the courts\u2019 relationship with extra-judicial bodies such as the\npeople\u2019s congress, the Communist Party, governmental organizations and public prosecu-\ntion. The author holds the view that due to historical reasons and the political system,\ncourts are the weakest organs compared to other powers, and the most fundamental and\n\n134 Chinese JIL (2017)\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n https://academ\n\nic.oup.com\n/chinesejil/article/16/1/134/2965770 by R\n\n.G\n. M\n\nenzies Library, Building #2, Australian N\national U\n\nniversity user on 22 July 2021\n\n\n\nserious problem is that the people\u2019s congress, the Party organ, the government and the\nprocuratorate at all levels have the de facto power to \u201csupervise\u201d courts in handling indi-\nvidual cases (p. 63).\n\n5. The topic of Chapter 3 is the professionalization of the judiciary. The author dis-\ncusses the qualification, the appointment and the rights of judges in the context of the\nJudges Law and its practice. Then the author devotes much space to discussing the judi-\ncial corruption in China. The author thinks that the professional quality of Chinese\njudges is not only determined by their legal knowledge, moral standards and judicial ex-\nperience, but is also affected by the external environment in which they function.\nImproving the ethical standards of Chinese judges is among the most critical of ongoing\nefforts towards the judicial reform (p. 86).\n\n6. Named \u201cThe Criminal Trial Process\u201d, Chapter 4 mainly examines the most funda-\nmental and controversial subjects arising from the wording and application of The\nCriminal Procedure Law (1996) and its amendment (2012). Then it discusses the review-\ning system of the death penalty. Eventually it introduces several cases of injustice and ana-\nlyses the lessons learned from them. The author thinks that the all-around criticism on\nThe Criminal Procedure Law (1996) is not surprising since it reflects the phenomenal\ntransition of Chinese criminal system: the Law is working in some cases while neglected\nin others, and the effectiveness of the Law depends on the strength and weakness of the\nvarious players involved (p. 132). The author also thinks that China\u2019s current important\ntask is to improve the institutional capacity and professional quality of various actors\ninvolved in criminal justice proceedings.\n\n7. Chapter 5 stresses on the civil trial process. On the basis of the introduction to\nChinese civil laws and civil procedure laws, this chapter identifies the characters of civil\nlitigation since the 1980s in China and numerous reform measures initiated by Chinese\ncourts. The author describes the reality of settling civil and economic disputes as two pic-\ntures: one is the emphasis on the modern conceptions of the rule of law, due process, liti-\ngation efficiency, the system of withdrawal, burden of proof and evidentiary rules; the\nother is that of judges continuously applying the mediatory method of handling civil dis-\nputes, proactively getting involved in both the pre-trial and trial stages. The author holds\nthe view that Chinese courts and judges have played a unique role in strengthening the ju-\ndicial settlement of disputes and ultimately contributing to social stability and economic\nprosperity (p. 163).\n\n8. The administrative trial process is dealt with in Chapter 6. It begins with identifying\nthe limitations of the Administrative Litigation Law (the ALL) promulgated in 1989 by\nthe National People\u2019s Congress with respect to the scope of case acceptance and handling.\nThen it discusses the shortcomings of the jurisdiction of the court in handling administra-\ntive cases and the appeal for establishing special administrative courts. After that, it re-\nviews the main differences between the adjudication of civil and administrative cases. The\nfourth section analyses the relatively small number of administrative cases and relatively\nhigh rate of administrative cases won by plaintiffs due to voluntary or reluctant with-\ndrawal. Eventually it illustrates the positive impact of the ALL and the challenges faced by\nthe Chinese judiciary in improving its immature administrative justice.\n\n9. Named \u201cThe Role of the Legal Profession in the Judicial System\u201d, Chapter 7 first re-\nviews the Chinese traditional disregard for lawyers and recent development. Second, it\ndiscusses the lawyers law and legal practice about qualifications to become a licensed law-\nyer, the management system for lawyers and law firms, the personal rights of lawyers, the\nrights of lawyers during the course of litigation and their duties and legal liability.

Eventually it identifies the ten-\nsions between lawyers and law enforcement officers.\n\n10. In \u201cConclusion\u201d, the author reviews progress and limitations from the perspective\nof a judicial system with Chinese characteristics. Then Chinese judicial reform is dis-\ncussed as an unfolding process of modernization rather than westernization. Finally the\nauthor maps the path towards further judicial reform in such an interdependent approach\nas improving the competence and ethics of the judiciary, accelerating internal court re-\nform and strengthening judicial independence (pp. 250-251).\n\n11. Chinese judicial system is a maze with complicated hierocracy and challenges. The\nresearch regarding it is easy to initiate, but hard to conduct and complete. As a witness\nhaving been educated and having worked in China in her early years, the author knows\nChinese judicial system fairly well and has contemplated it for a long time. With great fa-\nmiliarity she reviews clearly the history and development of Chinese judiciary, and identi-\nfies certainly the progress and problems in Chinese judicial system and reform. As an\nobserver teaching and researching Chinese law in Europe in recent years, the author has\nbeen paying continuous attention to Chinese judicial reform, thinks about the challenges\nand resolution regarding Chinese judicial reform from a global and multiple perspective,\nand draws independent conclusions on the course and direction of Chinese judicial re-\nform. Much inspiration comes from such suggestions or conclusions as: the Chinese ad-\nministrative litigation system is currently infantile; Chinese judicial reform is an\nunfolding process of modernization rather than westernization; China should strengthen\njudicial independence in future judicial reform; the judicial system and reform in post-\nMao China are stumbling towards justice. Therefore there is no doubt that legal practi-\ntioners, scholars, policy-makers as well as investors can benefit a lot from this volume.\n\n12. In the same year when this volume was published, the fourth plenary session of the\n18th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee published the full text of the\ndecision on comprehensively advancing the rule of law. Ever since then, Chinese judicial\nreform is being promoted in the framework of main task of the CPC and national funda-\nmental policy. More and more problems including such key ones as registration for ac-\ncepting cases, budget management at provincial level, de-administration of judicature,\nestablishment of circuit courts and the recording system of interference to judiciary from\nleading cadres mentioned or implied in this volume have been settled or possible solutions\nhave been delivered to them. It seems that the judicial system and reform in China are\ncurrently striding towards justice.\n\nYANG Chengming\nBeijing Institute of Technology Institute of International Law\n\nAdvance Access publication 1 February 2017\ndoi:10.1093/chinesejil/jmw049\n\n136 Chinese JIL (2017)\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n https://academ\n\nic.oup.com\n/chinesejil/article/16/1/134/2965770 by R\n\n.G\n.
