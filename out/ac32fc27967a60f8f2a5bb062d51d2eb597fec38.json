Increasingly decoupled from parties, unions, and the state, young\npeople glide seamlessly across previously assumed boundaries: culture and pol-\nitics, individual and organization, subjectivity and collectivity, virtual and\n\u201creal.\u201d This article presents findings from a systematic review of research on\nyouth politics and demonstrates the new direction through three main cate-\ngories: repression, incorporation, and exclusion, relationships between state\ninstitutions and youth identities; generational, cultural, and digital lenses, the\ninnovative trends for theorizing current patterns of youth politics; and unset-\ntling politics, the fusion and diffusion of youth political dexterity. The article\nconcludes by highlighting current strengths and proposing future steps to build\non this new direction. \n\nYoung people\u2019s political participation in contemporary Latin America diverges\nfrom that of previous generations. Youth practice glides seamlessly across pre-\n\nviously fixed boundaries between culture and politics, individual and organization,\nsubjectivity and collectivity, virtual and \u201creal.\u201d Their actions are increasingly decou-\npled from parties, unions, and the state. Global cultural repertoires intersect with\nlocalized and territorialized interests. Activism extends beyond the traditional site,\nthe university, to marginalized sectors of urban and rural society, feminist and\nindigenous politics, sexuality, and cyberspace. These changes are crucial to under-\nstanding not just political systems but also \u201ceconomic, social, and cultural practices\nthat might engender a democratic ordering for society as a whole\u201d (\u00c1lvarez et al.\n1998, 2). \n\nYoung people\u2019s political subjectivities and practices signal the region\u2019s emergent\ntrends (see, notably, Oliart and Feixa 2012).

Nevertheless, the particularities\nof the Latin American experience\u2014rapid urbanization; the coexistence of premod-\nern, modern, and postmodern social organization; the legacies of conquest and\nimperialism; the historical role of university students in social change; the newness\nof democratic institutions; and the persistence of high levels of inequality\u2014inform\nhow young people endeavor to reimagine the social order. \n\nViolence and marginalization mark the everyday experiences and life chances of\npoor youth (Imbusch et al. 2011; World Bank 2011). However, polling data show\nthat the region\u2019s youth, across socioeconomic statuses, are personally optimistic but\nsocially pessimistic about the future (Galambos and Loreto Mart\u00ednez 2007). The\ngrowth of the middle class (Ferreira et al. 2012) and democratically elected left and\ncenter-left governments (Blanco and Grier 2013) present new conditions. Unique\nforms of cultural politics have emerged in light of young people\u2019s diverse aspirations,\nvalues, investments, and interests shaped by gender, ethnicity, cultural practices, and\nspatial relationships. \n\nThis article presents findings of a systematic analysis of contemporary literature\non youth politics and culture in Latin America. Using the search engines EBSCO,\nInternational Bibliography of the Social Sciences (ProQuest), Red de Revistas Cien-\nt\u00edficas de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, Espa\u00f1a y Portugal, and Google Scholar, we\nlooked for publications that included three terms or their synonyms: youth, politics,\nand Latin America (or individual country names). We selected more than 75\nresearch publications\u2014journal articles, monographs, and edited volumes\u2014in Span-\nish and English published since 2000. We read each publication, synthesizing the\ncontent into categories and subcategories. Consistent with the literature reviewed,\nyouth is defined here less as a chronological age than a \u201cmaterial basis associated\nwith age\u201d (Margulis and Urresti 1996, 3) before full participation in adult eco-\nnomic, familial, political, and professional roles. \n\nOur review captured three main categories that together clearly show the new\ndirection of research on youth politics. The first is repression, incorporation, exclu-\nsion: relationships between state institutions and youth identities. This provides his-\ntorical and contextual explanations for current patterns of youth politics. The\nsecond category is youth politics through generational, cultural, and digital lenses.\nIt comprises the innovative trends for theorizing current patterns of youth politics.\nThe final category is unsettling politics: fusion and diffusion of youth political dex-\nterity. It encompasses the shifting foci for investigating youth politics, practices, and\nunderlying meanings. The article concludes by highlighting the strengths of current\nliterature and proposing future steps to build on this new direction. \n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 133\n\n\n\nREPRESSION, INCORPORATION, EXCLUSION\n\nThe review captured five distinct historical and contextual legacies in the relation-\nships between state institutions and youth identities that oscillate between repres-\nsion, incorporation, and exclusion. They are students demanding reform, targeting\nof youth culture, revolutionary incorporation, neoliberal exclusion of youth politics,\nand criminalization of youth bodies. Youth activism reflects engagement with key\nstruggles, whether to end oligarchy and create a pan-Latin American identity (in the\nearly twentieth century; see Faletto 1986) or to confront emergent technologies of\nneoliberal exclusion (in recent decades; see V\u00e1squez and Vommaro 2009).\n\nStudents Demanding Reform \n\nFrom the 1918 C\u00f3rdoba reform movement in Argentina (Tunnermann 1998) to\nthe 2012 #YoSoy132 protests against the Mexican media and political establish-\nment, university students have led calls for democratization and modernization of\nnational institutions, including higher education (Liebman et al. 1972). In the early\ntwentieth century, university students from the economic elite were cast as the pri-\nmary protagonists in societal transitions to modern state forms and liberal demo-\ncratic structures (Feixa 2010, 14). The terms student and youth became synonymous\nas student movements formed the intellectual center of modernizing (Faletto 1986)\nand marked the emergence of youth as a \u201cvanguard of future society,\u201d involved in a\ncultural revolution as much as a political one (Feixa 2000). \n\nTargeting of  Youth Culture\n\nYouth culture, defined by the consumption of cultural commodities, such as film,\nmusic, and clothing, has long been viewed with suspicion by adult-run institutions.\nWhen it emerged in the mid-twentieth century, youth culture faced suppression\nfrom dominant conservative sectors, which stigmatized and even criminalized what\nwas being accepted by modern society as \u201crebellious youth\u201d (Gonz\u00e1lez 2012; Guy\n2008). Similarly, in early twentieth-century Argentina, children and youth with\nnonnormative behavior and living conditions were criminalized, defined as perverts\nand anarchists, and regularly removed from their families (Guy 2008; also see\nRizzini 2011). Military dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s continued to target\nyouth. Modifying previous repressive civil practices, the Argentine dictatorship\nremoved teenage children from parents and homes (Guy 2008). \n\nRevolutionary Incorporation \n\nRevolutionary states have made focused attempts to engage youth from all back-\ngrounds (not exclusively university students) as political actors. Revolutionary states\nsuch as Nicaragua and Cuba incorporated youth participation through mobilization\nefforts in, for example, literacy campaigns, coffee harvests, and women\u2019s organiza-\ntions (Dom\u00ednguez 2006; Petrie 1993). By the early twenty-first century, revolution-\n\n134 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nary states balanced earlier ideals with demands of the globalized market logics pres-\nent in daily life (Dom\u00ednguez 2003). Young people in Venezuela, Cuba, and Ecuador\nhave organized as youth in coalition with state actors to resist the harmful effects of\nneoliberalism (Petras and Veltmeyer 2011).\n\nNeoliberal Exclusion of  Youth Politics\n\nPolitical and economic neoliberalism redefined the relationship between the state\nand civil society, including youth. Beginning in the 1990s, intense privatization and\nmarketization created varying effects on social mobility, liberal technical expertise\ndelegitimated government social welfare, and political parties rejected the responsi-\nbility of protecting vulnerable populations, including young people. The escalation\nof social violence disproportionately affects working-class and poor youth (Reguillo\n2003b; Celis and S\u00e1nchez 2011). However, the local and civil society initiatives that\nhave replaced state-provided services offer few guarantees to improve the lives of\nyouth (Maclure and Sotelo 2004). Meanwhile, neoliberal political culture empha-\nsizes values of consumerism, individualism, and commodification (Oppenheim\n2003). Neoliberalism\u2019s narrow view of civil society\u2019s role in political action and\nsocial change coincides with the emergence of \u201cnoninstitutionalized youth politics\u201d\n(Oppenheim 2003). \n\nCriminalization of  Youth\n\nBy the latter decades of the twentieth century, struggles over inclusion and exclusion\nof youth had displaced earlier conflict between the traditional and the modern\n(Faletto 1986). The literature critiques criminalization of youth as endemic to\nneoliberal state apparatuses that attempt to deflect social conflict and curtail expres-\nsions of dissent. Specifically, being in public spaces as a young person, the leisure\ntime resulting from lack of work, dissent practices that young people have devel-\noped, and engaging in youth-centered forms of sociality have become \u201cjudicialized\u201d\nand made illegal (V\u00e1squez and Vommaro  2009, 57). This individualizes and crim-\ninalizes the harmful effects of neoliberal policies on youth.  De la Cuadra (2007)\nrefers to Chile\u2019s deployment of hypergovernability techniques to suppress secondary\nschool protests so as to achieve the appearance of a stable, harmonious economic\nenvironment. \n\nNevertheless, state exclusion through violence shifts according to the targeted\nyouth\u2019s social location (Celis and S\u00e1nchez 2011). Salazar (2008) also shows this in\nher comparison of Chilean secondary school protests with that of a group of street\nchildren harboring three young runaways. The secondary school protesters met with\nunusual repression, suggestive of the Pinochet era, generating media and public cri-\ntique of law enforcement and support for the protesters. Helping young escapees\nfrom abuse, the street children experienced the same repression they encountered on\na daily basis, and the public and media saw them (as usual) as criminals deserving\nsuch treatment. \n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 135\n\n\n\nOverall, Latin American states too often respond to youth through \u201cmarginal-\nization, rendering invisible, or controlling\u201d rather than inclusion or the granting of\nrights (Alvarado and Vommaro 2010, 12). Youth are frequently ignored until their\nproblems \u201care at the point of explosion, when little can be done\u201d without public\nstructures in place able to address the tensions at hand (Cordera Campos and Lerner\n2006). Dominant public discourses viewing youth as a \u201csocial problem\u201d typically\nlead to state repression whereby social inequality is reproduced and market interests\nprotected.\n\nThese historical and contextual legacies in the relationships between state insti-\ntutions and youth identities shape youth politics today. Youth nowadays prefer non-\ninstitutionalized forms of politics, such as those linked to \u201cterritory\u201d within urban\npopular, rural, and indigenous movements. The territorialization of politics\n(V\u00e1squez and Vommaro 2009) blurs distinctions between productive and reproduc-\ntive identities, focusing instead on place, such as neighborhoods and communities,\nand on friendship ties (Llanos Erazo and Unda Lara 2013). Young people and their\nadvocates are forced into a context of self-management of state tasks, in which civil\nsociety performs tasks previously managed by the state, such as social welfare and\nhealth. This leads to the emergence of new identities as youth develop new mean-\nings and practices, as local social networks politicize everyday life and as routine\nantagonisms (i.e., with law enforcement) become the source of political analyses. \n\nIn these local spaces embedded in social networks, youth favor direct action as\nactivists (militantes) in newly politicized fields (V\u00e1squez and Vommaro 2009). \n\nYOUTH POLITICS THROUGH GENERATIONAL, \nCULTURAL, AND DIGITAL LENSES\n\nThe review captured three innovative trends for theorizing current patterns of youth\npolitics. Generational transformation\u2014the social importance of how each age\ncohort encounters unique historical conditions at a different chronological point in\nlife\u2014almost takes for granted the incorporation of youth into political change. The\nglobalized circulation of commodities and ideas, combined with underfunctioning\nstate institutions, renders culture a focal site for social organization of political\nchange and citizenship. Furthermore, an emergent literature theorizes how youth\ntransform political activism in the virtual world through digital technologies (or\nInternet communication technologies, ICTs). \n\nGenerational Transformation\n\nThe theme of youth generations holds significant theoretical currency in Latin\nAmerican youth studies (Feixa 2000; Berm\u00fadez and Mart\u00ednez 2010). Leccardi and\nFeixa (2011) argue that the concept is \u201cone of the few Spanish [from Spain] contri-\nbutions to universal sociological thought.\u201d Drawing from the work of Ortega y\nGasset (1923) and Mannheim (1952), generation is theorized as a central social\ndivide that drives historical events. Youth is not an obvious natural category of the\n\n136 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nhuman condition but instead is significant only when framed by time and space\n(Cogo and Barsi Lopes 2011; Bonvillani et al. 2008, 49). The centrality of the con-\ncept in Spanish-language youth studies orients the field toward a strong association\nbetween youth agency and social change (cf. Gordon and Taft 2011). \n\nThe theoretical centrality of generation in Latin American scholarship and\njournalism reflects a logic closely tied to the region\u2019s political history. Each succes-\nsive age cohort intersects with a different political and societal context, creating new\nsocial generations (Mannheim 1952). Students acted as the political vanguard in the\nearly twentieth century, coinciding with the university\u2019s emergence as a primary\nsocial institution during the modern formation of Latin American nation-states\n(Aguilera 2009). Students at midcentury imagined change inspired by the Cuban\nrevolution and the Alliance for Progress and grappled with the issues of human\nrights in authoritarian societies, modernization, limited socioeconomic mobility,\nand ideologies of scientific progress (Faletto 1986). In each era, youth subjectively\nconstruct identity with certain criteria that make a recognizable \u201cwe,\u201d including a\nbreak or rift with previous generations. Accordingly, a political generation implies a\nrejection of the existing political order and an intention to change the nation\u2019s polit-\nical course (Bonvillani et al. 2008).\n\nThe social, communicative, and political particularities of contemporary youth\ngenerations are a central framework for exploring societal change. Mart\u00edn-Barbero\n(2002) argues that the region\u2019s post-1960s youth have experienced time and social-\nity differently; they are the first generation to live in a peer-normed, as opposed to\nparent- or ancestor-normed, culture. They share with youth globally the status of\n\u201ctime immigrants\u201d who \u201carrive at a new era from diverse temporalities, but all shar-\ning the same legends\u201d (of mass culture) and models for the future. The contempo-\nrary cohort has formed new relationships with digital technologies, has erased tradi-\ntional gender boundaries, and has been exposed to cultural globalization that \u201cby\nnecessity requires new forms of social exclusion on a planetary scale\u201d (Portillo et al.\n2012, 141). Since the 1990s, identity work conditioned in aesthetic reflexivity and\nmultiple narratives has generated political action that is deinstitutionalized and ter-\nritorialized in local, everyday conditions (see Guaran\u00e1 de Castro 2008 on rural\nBrazil; Molinari 2006 on Argentina). \n\nA generational framework also imposes limits on theorizing youth political\npractice. As a common-sense framework, it obscures other, actually occurring youth\npolitical identities (Berm\u00fadez and Mart\u00ednez 2010). Moreover, generations coincide\nand overlap (Aguilera 2009; Leccardi and Feixa 2011), and perhaps globalization\nprocesses produce nonlinear biographies whereby being young no longer structures\nsocial or political cleavages as in previous periods (Rossi 2009, 2010). Transformed\ncollective action in contemporary societies discourages \u201cstrong identities\u201d and\ninstead fosters precarious, fragmented, and ephemeral political solidarities. How-\never, this flexible, dexterous approach to politics might itself be understood as a gen-\nerational location, presenting \u201ccertain definite modes of behavior, feeling and\nthought\u201d (Mannheim 1952, 291) that emerge from the social organization of every-\nday life. Youth encounter fluid, multisited, and deinstitutionalized political con-\n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 137\n\n\n\ntexts. Despite its constraints, generation as a concept has created rich terrain\nthrough which to debate the relationships among youth, biography, and historical\nsocial change.\n\nCulture, Politics, and Citizenship\n\nA convincing argument emerges about why culture should be a central theoretical\nprinciple in the study of youth politics. We readily acknowledge our own suspicions\nthat \u201creading resistance into culture\u201d threatens to impose a theoretical and ideolog-\nical agenda on activities that do not change state policies or that other actors do not\nview as political. Feixa (2010) counterargues that culture is a central space for social\ninnovation. He makes an important distinction: a focus on political participation is\nfundamentally adult-centric and politics-centric, spaces and activities from which\nyouth are excluded. In contrast, a cultural focus yields a more precise understanding\nof the public sphere, which is created through cultural practice. Furthermore, a cul-\ntural framework transcends a single age cohort, in which \u201cthe rules of the game are\nnot presupposed, but rather created in action across generations\u201d (Feixa (2010, 16).\nThis approach aligns with the definition of cultural politics from \u00c1lvarez et al., \u201cthe\nprocess enacted when sets of social actors shaped by and embodying different cul-\ntural meanings come into conflict with one another\u201d (1998, 2).\n\nBonvillani et al. (2008, 50) argue that if a political generation implies a rupture\nwith the existing political order, then broader criteria are required to capture prac-\ntices not viewed as \u201cdoing politics\u201d in the existing order. Youth draw from their own\nsubjectivities rather than from political parties or student movements, as Roatta\nAcevedo (2007) notes, referring to Garavito\u2019s concept of micropolitics (2000).\nMicropolitics address social practices from which state structures and legal authority\nemerge. Macropolitics emphasize the institutional power of the state, government\nauthorities, and the law; micropolitics address the influence and capacity that devel-\nops or exists prior to these. Youth also create a politics of event whereby youth,\nthrough their music, aesthetics, and lifestyles, make their very existence a form of\npolitics (Mart\u00ednez 2008, 166; see also Osorio Venegas 2003). \n\nScholars also draw from performativity theories, in which the body is a form of\nbiopolitical resistance. Youth politics cannot be understood as deviant but rather as\na politics of demodernization, moral anticipation, and micropolitics (pol\u00edtica de la\nvida) (Mu\u00f1oz Gaviria and Mart\u00ednez Posada 2007). These new political forms are\ncharacterized by freedom (freedom to adopt plural or multiple paths, as well as\nbiographization), using one\u2019s own life as a means for political action, and reliability\n(placing importance on trust in relationships with others) (Mu\u00f1oz Gaviria and\nMart\u00ednez Posada 2007). \n\nCultural politics in Latin America entail resignifying \u201cthe very meanings of\nreceived notions of citizenship, political representation and participation, and as a\nconsequence, democracy itself\u201d (\u00c1lvarez et al. 1998, 2). Cultural citizenship is a\nwidely used term for  imagining new relationships to the nation-state, in contrast to\nseeing citizenship only in formal political activity. Reguillo (2003a) and Mart\u00ednez\n\n138 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nPosada and Mu\u00f1oz Gaviria (2009), among others, use the term to overcome previ-\nous problematic descriptions of the relationship between youth and the state. Previ-\nously, youth were constructed as under the tutelage of the state, as \u201cnot yet citizens,\u201d\nas only a dangerous problem to be managed, or as a vulnerable group in need of\nassistance. Cultural citizenship centers on new forms of political participation based\nin daily practice. The concept \u201crecognizes other spheres of citizenship and the polit-\nical related with music, artistic expression, different forms of inhabiting the city and\nthe body, etc. Youth citizenship from this view would be performativity that takes\non new forms of social and political incursion and articulation\u201d (Herrera and\nMu\u00f1oz Gaviria 2008).\n\nCitizenship as defined by notions of liberal democracy is also challenged by\nyouth politics. Youth rework the category to include multiple identities through\ntheir relationships to global commodities. They struggle for rights rather than for\nliberal democracy. \u201cYouth construct a notion of citizenship, or better said, of poli-\ntics, that combines equality and difference\u201d (Alvarado and Vommaro 2010, 10).\nReguillo (2003a) argues that cultural citizenship, a category based on recognition\nused successfully by LGBT and racial and ethnic groups, is a viable strategy for cre-\nating political, social, and economic citizenship. Citizenship, in this assessment,\nincludes much more than electoral politics and extends to include protests, working\nin community activities, and joining others to solve common problems. To do\nmuch of this work, youth have turned to digital media (Arriagada and Schuster\n2008).\n\nDigital Technologies\n\nDigital communication technologies (often referred to as ICTs, or Internet commu-\nnication technologies) constitute a rapidly shifting online media ecosystem in which\nyouth build peer cultures (Mart\u00edn-Barbero 2002). Being under age 30 is one of the\nlargest predictors of social media use (Portillo et al. 2012; Valenzuela 2013), and\ntechnological competency is characterized as \u201ca gift with which to place oneself into\nthe speed of the era\u201d (Mart\u00edn-Barbero 1996, 2). In 2013, youth inhabited an online\nmedia ecosystem which included social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Orket,\nTwitter), YouTube, gaming sites and systems, microblogging and blogging sites\n(Tumblr), and interactive online news (from both print newspapers and new jour-\nnalism). ICT technology shifts youth from being information consumers to infor-\nmation producers (Arriagada and Schuster 2008). \n\nAuthors overwhelmingly endorse Mart\u00edn-Barbero\u2019s 2002 call to create a cartog-\nraphy of communication realities embedded in conditionalities rather than absolutes\n(Padilla de la Torre and Flores M\u00e1rquez 2011). Unlike often-leveled accusations of\n\u201cslacktivism\u201d (see Christenson 2011), Spanish-language scholarship frequently cites\nthe \u201cdigital optimists,\u201d particularly Mart\u00edn-Barbero (2002) and Livingstone (2008),\nwho emphasize opportunities for community engagement, self-expression, new\nsocialities, and emergent literacy skills. Questions about the role of online and\nmobile platforms in citizen action have moved from whether social media foster\n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 139\n\n\n\nsocial protest (e.g., Gladwell 2010 vs. Howard et al., 2011) to \u201chow and under what\nconditions\u201d (Valenzuela 2013, 921).\n\nThe social inequalities that affect youth political participation offline do not\ndisappear in the virtual world (Pedrozo 2013). Legacies of authoritarian regimes and\ndisillusionment with democracy manifest themselves in the dominant role of youth\nand accompanying social media usage (Cogo and Barsi Lopes 2011; Valenzuela et\nal. 2012). The urban-rural gap in youth access is significant (Dos Santos 2009).\nActivist strategies strongly embedded in digital technologies become a way to sub-\nvert the antidemocratic tendencies found in traditional political and communica-\ntion institutions (Cand\u00f3n Mena 2013). Mexican university students in the\n#YoSoy132 movement (D\u00edaz Alba 2013; Rodr\u00edguez 2013) fused a range of activities\nto contest the illegitimacy and corruption of the 2012 presidential elections and\nmedia complicity. The combination of demonstrations organized online and exten-\nsive social media and Internet videos produced new connections across public and\nprivate universities and connections with emergent digital antineoliberal movements\nglobally (Alonso 2013).\n\nYoung people\u2019s intensive ICT use makes the development of broadband access\na youth citizenship issue. Cuba, Colombia, Chile, and Honduras have instituted\nyouth technology programs (Cristancho et al. 2008). Online cultures blur the lines\nbetween consumption and politics (Mart\u00edn-Barbero 2002; Garc\u00eda Canclini 2001),\ncreating novel ways to encourage even traditional electoral participation (e.g., on\nVenezuela and voter turnout, see Vila 2010). \n\nOnline, young people have easier access to contacts, which facilitates offline\nmobilization (Harlow 2012; Valenzuela et al. 2012). The Internet becomes a space\nfor youth expression of aspirations, which leads to alternate framings of the world\nto be addressed through politics (Galindo Ram\u00edrez 2012; Harlow 2012; Vandegrift\n2015). Youth throughout Latin America use technology to expand the public sphere\nand construct new citizenship practices. Educational institutions and supranational\norganizations promote online initiatives that they hope will combat \u201cundesirable\u201d\nyouth behaviors, such as apathy toward electoral politics and engaging in delin-\nquency (Blasco and Hansen 2006). However, we see a richer vein of inquiry stem-\nming from the ways young people themselves creatively deploy online technologies\nthat coincide with the \u201ccultural turn\u201d and other transitions in political action. \n\nUNSETTLING POLITICS: FUSION AND DIFFUSION\nOF YOUTH POLITICAL DEXTERITY\n\nThe review captured four major foci in empirical studies of youth politics: prob-\nlematizing youth\u2019s relationship with formal politics, theorizing how youth politics\nfuses the political-cultural dichotomy, exploring new practices and meanings under-\nlying youth politics, and identifying social hierarchies as influence on practices and\nmeanings. \n\n140 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nYouth\u2019s Relationship to Formal Politics \n\nUntil the 2000s, scholarship generally worked with predefined notions of youth pol-\nitics based on what youth were doing in relation to formal political institutions. Low\nlevels of youth involvement in state-linked organizations, processes, and structures\nwere interpreted as political disengagement and apathy, even signs of social disinte-\ngration. Since the start of the new millennium, youth\u2019s relationship to formal poli-\ntics is problematized by posing it as a question in need of investigation, thereby chal-\nlenging assumptions of political apathy or social disintegration (see national reviews\nfrom Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, and Chile, respectively, by Chaves and Nu\u00f1ez\n2012; Cubides 2010; Equipo Centro de Estudios en Juventud 2010; and Romero\nand Moreira 2010; regional compilations by Rodr\u00edguez 2013; Alvarado and Vom-\nmaro 2010).\n\nIn Colombia, Galindo Ram\u00edrez and Acosta S\u00e1nchez (2008) found that second-\nary school students held diverse ideological positions, responded to formal political\nactivity (issues, persons), were highly supportive of voting in elections, and proposed\nsolutions to current national problems. However, students explicitly rejected politics\nbecause they associated them with corruption, special interests, and privileges,\nwhich they scorned. In Brazil, a survey among eight thousand youth found that\nthree-fourths informed themselves about political issues or participated in political\nactivities; over one-fourth participated in a religious, sport, or cultural group; and\nalmost one-fifth had participated in collective action to improve their neighborhood\n(Silva and Souto 2009; Cerrano 2009). Brazilian youth did not explicitly reject pol-\nitics altogether, but they rejected formally organized political activity because they\nlacked trust in its traditional operators; that is, politicians (Cerrano 2009, 21) and\nthey associated it with limited forms of involvement pertaining to the adult world\n(Dayrell et al. 2009, 29).\n\nIn Chile, frequent social media use increased the likelihood that users would\nengage in citizen activism, including attending demonstrations, contacting media,\nand meeting with authorities (Valenzuela et al. 2012; Valenzuela 2013). Activists\nand the larger urban adult population used social media platforms during multi-\nissue, coalitional social protests widely supported by the larger public (Sehnbruch\nand Donoso 2011). Social media allowed users to express opinions and join causes,\nall of which were positively and significantly associated with protest behavior. At the\nsame time, Web 2.0 technology use did not always correspond with elite-challeng-\ning political positions (Valenzuela 2013).\n\nBy problematizing youth\u2019s relationship to formal politics, assumptions of youth\npolitical apathy or social disintegration are rejected (Bonvillani et al. 2008, 50).\nIndeed, teenage activists across the Americas reported feeling aggrieved by adult dis-\ncourses normalizing a \u201cyouth apathy crisis.\u201d In contrast, teenagers perceived youth\npolitical participation as common activity but shaped by a complex scenario of bar-\nriers and opportunities produced by class, race, and gender (Gordon and Taft\n2011). \n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 141\n\n\n\nHow Youth Politics Fuses \nthe Political-Cultural Dichotomy\n\nHaving demonstrated that youth are politically engaged, our attention turns to how\nthey are engaged, and especially how they \u201cdo politics\u201d differently, such that their\nactions fuse the dichotomy between politics and culture. Youth do not merely add\ncultural aspects to existing political forms but instead change the nature of the latter\nby gliding seamlessly across and fusing different actions, sites, and identities; for\nexample, from subjective resistance to collective mobilizations. \n\nParticipants in the Antifascist Radical Anarchist Movement in Bogot\u00e1,\nColombia subscribed to diverse ideas and practices, such as straight edge and\npunk, but were united in their rejection of the system, the state, and authority and\nin their affirmation of emancipatory ideals (Roatta Acevedo 2007). Young\nactivists working on sexual health in Ecuador and Peru employed interconnected\nstrategies ranging from the individual level (developing themselves as activists) to\nthe organizational level (building their own organizations) to the community level\n(responding to adult allies and changing their peers) all the way to the macro level\n(influencing policy reform) (Coe et al. 2012). They selected strategies according\nto the degree to which they succeeded, not in achieving formal political demands\nbut in negotiating alternative notions of \u201cyouth\u201d as worthy agents of social\nchange. As in previous generations (Chaves and Nu\u00f1ez 2012), youth still organize\nas students, but this looks different today, as the case of the Chilean Ping\u00fcino\nmovement illustrates. In this case, secondary students moved their tactics between\npublic spaces and school grounds and expanded demands from eliminating a fee\nfor university entrance exams to reducing the commercialization of education (de\nla Cuadra 2007). \n\nYouth dexterity across diverse forms of action is especially apparent in social\nmedia use (Arriagada and Schuster 2008; Cristancho et al. 2008; Vila 2010). The\nPing\u00fcino activists in Chile built a call for education reform around social media\n(Portillo et al. 2012; Valenzuela 2013). Young Chilean hip-hop activists countered\nmedia stereotypes of marginalized youth by creating alternative videos, publicizing\ntocatas (live music concerts), and communicating more easily with organizations\nnationwide (Osorio Venegas 2003). Hundreds of thousands of Colombians world-\nwide were mobilized via Facebook to march against the FARC (Markey 2008);\namong the key organizers globally, all were younger than 30 (Hern\u00e1ndez V\u00e1squez\n2014). Colombian student organizations engaged in online discussions of bull-\nfighting (Tamayo Molina and Villa Zapata 2009) and spurred offline activism\nthrough Facebook pages in campaigns to defeat cuts in educational spending and\nto protest the end of education as a right for all citizens (Galindo Ram\u00edrez 2012).\nYouth used online sites for microreporting and other forms of journalism in\nMexico and other places where traditional journalism is dangerous (Tols\u00e1 2011).\nPolitical organizing against state inaction against crime and violence coalesced\nonline in Facebook groups and real-time reporting on Twitter (Harlow 2012:\nAlexander 2011). \n\n142 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nBy theorizing how youth politics fuses the dichotomy between politics and cul-\nture, it becomes clear that \u201cyouth have not rejected collective action but they act in\na different manner\u201d (Calder\u00f3n 2011, 90).\n\nNew Practices and Meanings \nUnderlying Youth Politics\n\nWe draw on Galindo Ram\u00edrez and Acosta S\u00e1nchez 2010, along with V\u00e1squez and\nVommaro 2009, who propose practices and meanings as useful terms for exploring\nthe distinct qualities that underlie youth politics. In Argentina, young people\nrejected not merely formal politics per se, but more important, the styles of leader-\nship and means of decisionmaking associated with delegated representative power\nstructures (Bonvillani et al. 2008, 50). Youth preferred \u201cprotagonistic citizenship,\u201d\nor involvement in decisions about collective action, as well as in direct actions that\nappropriated public spaces. Two other central features were horizontality in organ-\nizing, leadership, and decisionmaking; and autonomy from labor unions, political\nparties, and government agencies (Bonvillani et al. 2008, 60). \n\nIn Ecuador, youth organizations shared a commitment to participatory democ-\nracy (Llanos Erazo and Unda Lara 2013). Young activists across the Americas pre-\nferred spaces that allowed them to make a difference over merely having a voice,\norganizations that fostered a collective rather than an elite group, and youth-led\nrather than adult-supervised actions (Taft and Gordon 2013).\n\nCalder\u00f3n (2011, 90) uses the term new politicalness to capture Latin American\nyouth\u2019s preference for participating in small groups engaged in direct actions in their\nimmediate community, actions that offer concrete results and are oriented toward\nlong-term change. Emphasizing difference rather than sameness, young people\u2019s\nnotion of autonomy begins with the individual: \u201cyouth collective action is distinct\ntoday because it values personal autonomy as a collective good and collective orien-\ntations value individual autonomy\u201d (Calder\u00f3n 2011, 79; for Chile see Equipo\nCentro de Estudios en Juventud 2010). \n\nRossi (2009, 491) similarly concludes that youth prioritize being faithful to a\n\u201ccause\u201d and to individual principles rather than to an organization. Indeed, young\nColombian activists frame their own subjective action as a source of capacity and\npower and as the solution to problems, instead of framing recommendations for\npolicy reform (Delgado Salazar and Herrera 2008). As a form of utopia, youth sub-\njectivity is not a future goal to work toward but an inspirational starting point from\nwhich to act practically in the present. And youth are well aware of their potential:\nyouth sexual health activists in Ecuador and Peru believe that their own groups and\nnetworks have made more progress in transforming gender hierarchies than the\nwider society and polity (Coe et al. 2013). \n\nThe virtual online world further reveals the new qualities of youth politics that\nemerge from \u201cnoninstitutionalized youth cultures\u201d (Portillo et al. 2012, 158). In\ncontrast to schools, electoral politics, and workplaces, where youth sociality is mar-\nginalized or criminalized, young people find the Internet an inviting space where\n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 143\n\n\n\nthey experience a \u201cmodicum of real power\u201d (Winocur 2006, 562). Through digital\ntechnologies, youth construct political identities that are recreational and dynamic\n(Ortega Guti\u00e9rrez and Ricaurte Quijano 2010), as evidenced by new online \u201cartistic\nmanifestations\u201d (Portillo et al. 2012), such as posting videos and visual culture in\nonline communities. The Internet contributes to the \u201ccarnivalization of power\u201d\u2014\nprotests that take on an element of fun and celebration through the use of humor\nand music. Moreover, with digital platforms, youth build movements that are more\ndecentralized and autonomous than those of previous generations of university stu-\ndent activists (Osorio Venegas 2003). \n\nBy exploring new practices and meanings underlying youth politics, scholars\nreveal their prefigurative quality, whereby youth actively contribute to constructing\nalternatives to existing social, cultural, and political structures. \n\nSocial Hierarchies as Influences \non Youth Practices and Meanings \n\nThe sources of the new practices and meanings underlying youth politics are varied.\nBonvillani et al. (2008) trace the qualities of horizontality, direct action, and auton-\nomy to the territorialization of politics and \u201cnew\u201d social movements that emerged\nin the 1980s, linked to neighborhoods and communities. For example, the flexible\nassociation forms preferred by contemporary Ecuadorian youth originate from the\nfeminist movement\u2019s earlier break with rigid organizational forms (Llanos Erazo and\nUnda Lara 2013). \n\nOther authors trace the qualities of subjectivism and difference to the expan-\nsion of neoliberalism, consumerism, globalization, and technology since the 1990s\n(Molinari 2006; Roatta Acevedo 2007). But even though an intersectional approach\nwas seldom used in earlier studies, multiple social hierarchies clearly stood out as a\nkey source of new practices and meanings, just as they also acted as barriers to youth\npolitics. Earlier youth studies focused on how youth politics informed class identi-\nties (e.g., Faletto 1986, 189). Contemporary research, in contrast, recognizes social\nclass as one of multiple identities that produce oppression and social action. \n\nYouth organized against ageism\u2014in their case, the systematic placement of chil-\ndren and youth at the bottom of the power hierarchy. Adult control over institutions\nthat young activists aim to access results in the marginalization of youth, the depre-\nciation of youth practices, and overall frustration among engaged youth. Young\nactivists across the Americas perceived that in most formal spaces, adults attempted\nto steer their learning processes and patronized them (Gordon and Taft 2011). In a\ncivic educational program in Costa Rica, adult facilitators\u2019 own lack of active citizen-\nship was found to be a crucial barrier for promoting children\u2019s participation (Fonseca\nand Bujanda 2011). For youth sexual health activists in Peru and Ecuador, the issue\nwas not whether or not adults were involved but how adults treated them, whether\nadults showed them respect and trusted their abilities (Coe et al. 2012). \n\nCombating ageism becomes an implicit framework through which citizenship\nrights are claimed. Brazilian NGOs advocated for youth social rights of citizenship\n\n144 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nthrough campaigning against violence in private and public spaces (Guidry 2003)\nand promoting youth protagonism (Jupp Kina 2012). Local political structures\nadopted by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Chiapas, Mexico ensured\nyouth involvement as autonomous education and health promoters (Barronet\n2008). Indeed, local government support has been crucial in changing attitudes\ntoward youth participation, as Cabannes notes in his study of four initiatives in\nBrazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela. The scholarship also notes the limitations of adults\nadvocating alone on behalf of what are perceived to be youth issues (Cabannes 2006;\nMaclure and Sotelo 2004). \n\nAdditional social hierarchies based on race, gender, and class require young\npeople to construct political action from different positions in which even the cate-\ngory \u201cyouth\u201d has distinct meanings (Guaran\u00e1 de Castro 2008; Margulis and Urresti\n1996). For many youth, the only resistance available is to subvert everyday interac-\ntions that constrain their livelihood in the most basic ways. This is illustrated by\nstudies of street children (Salazar 2008; Velosa 2008). In Brazil, where children\u2019s\nrights have been widely promoted (Rizzini 2011), black street children acted out\nstereotypical perceptions of them as violent criminals, knowing that their rights as\nchildren protected them from law enforcement (Velosa 2008). In Chile, where the\nstrong market ideology has produced public tolerance of social cleavages (de la\nCuadra 2007), the street children in Salazar\u2019s 2008 study knew they had little if\nnothing to fall back on, leading them to develop a cohesive social identity and\nshared strategies to navigate repression. \n\nGiven that young people construct politics from different intersecting posi-\ntions, Chaves and Nu\u00f1ez (2012) propose examining young activists\u2019 biographies to\ncapture the particular spaces and places of their action. They illustrate this with two\nwomen activists in secondary school in Buenos Aires, who, despite different class\nbackgrounds, channeled their involvement through community organizations and\nstudent centers instead of public spaces (i.e. the streets), due to the latter location\u2019s\nmasculine connotations. Both biographies reveal that dominant discourses privi-\nleged adult spheres for youth political participation. Nonetheless, the activists resis-\nted these discourses differently: the working-class activist remained outside the\nformal school organization to establish herself as a citizen equal to adults, whereas\nthe middle-class activist participated in the formal school organization but was\ndevalued for being too political, and therefore decided to re-evaluate her activism. \n\nUnequal access to human and social capital development are both replicated\nand contested online. Issues of concern to elite and middle-class youth, such as secu-\nrity (Harlow 2012), free speech (Vandegrift 2015), and animal rights, have found a\nlaunching point in Facebook and Twitter. The Ping\u00fcino movement focused on calls\nfor relief from high educational costs for middle-class families (Siavelis 2012)\u2014the\nvery youth with high rates of social media use. Although the literature does not ana-\nlyze these cases as class issues, their success may reflect the uneven contours of digital\nliteracy access to online platforms. \n\nWe note that student and youth activism online diverges from previous gener-\nations of university students in that they contest actions of \u201cpink tide\u201d states, such\n\nCOE AND VANDEGRIFT: YOUTH POLITICS 145\n\n\n\nas Venezuela and Honduras. Social media are also used to \u201cassert the voices of mar-\nginalized and minorities who might be ignored by the hegemonic media\u201d (Cogo and\nBarsi Lopes 2011, 36). Cogo and Barsi Lopes, drawing on the work of Stuart Hall,\ncaution that the representation of excluded youth fosters the danger of their \u201ctelevi-\nsualization\u201d; when poor youth have a media presence, the audience mistakenly con-\ncludes that social inequality has been resolved privately. Digital literacy\u2014a comfort-\nable relationship with technology and adequate skills to use it effectively\u2014remains\na key issue, more important than access (Pedrozo 2013). Nevertheless, Cogo and\nBarsi Lopes conclude in their investigation of youth NGO participants that social\nmedia create \u201chorizontal and democratic communication spaces\u201d for young people\ntypically excluded from full political participation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CURRENT STRENGTHS\nAND FUTURE STEPS\n\nWe wrote this review out of our own personal and professional excitement about the\nemergent research on youth politics and culture since the beginning of the new mil-\nlennium. Though national-level reviews exist, no previous effort has systematized\nthis scholarship from across Latin America, as we do here, to show the richness of\nthis new direction and highlight its strengths. A crucial strength is that empirically\nand theoretically, scholars are working\u2014indeed, struggling\u2014with the questions of\nwhat youth politics looks like and why. The results are more diverse and deeper\ninterpretations that eschew predefined ideas about what youth politics\u2014and maybe\npolitics in general\u2014should look like. \n\nWe are especially inspired by the wealth of studies of looking at digital tech-\nnologies through the lens of youth politics. Scholars embed their examinations of\nyouth politics in the wider social, political, and cultural changes in the region. Yet\neven with a clear emphasis on youth and peer-oriented generations, a final strength\nis the continued mindfulness of the historical and contemporary relationships\nbetween state institutions and youth identities. Adults and their initiatives continue\nto affect youth politics.\n\nNevertheless, we advocate future steps to enrich this new direction. The first\nstep is to extend the geographical basis of studies. We gained easy access to studies\nfrom the Southern Cone (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay), Mexico, Brazil, Colombia,\nand Venezuela. We are convinced that more studies of youth politics also exist from\nthe other Andean countries (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador), as well as Central America, but\nthese were largely absent from international databases for Spanish and English\nresearch publications. These patterns reflect the resource hierarchies that exist for\nscholars from the region. Many publications on youth gangs, including those from\nCentral America, focus on youth sociability. These studies may offer crucial insights,\nbut were excluded here due to limited resources. \n\nSecond, the need continues for an intersectionality perspective (Coe et al.\n2013). Many studies take into consideration the impact of social class hierarchies\nand differences on young people\u2019s political action (Margulis and Urresti 1996).\n\n146 LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY 57: 2\n\n\n\nFewer studies incorporate gender hierarchies. This surprising omission neglects the\nsignificant social and policy changes regarding gender injustice across the region\nsince the 1990s, shifts that have even influenced young men\u2019s activism about alter-\nnative masculinities (see Goicolea et al. 2014). Consideration of ethnicity and race\nis largely absent (Del Popolo et al. 2009; Jackson and Warren 2005, 567), despite\nthe consistent growth of mobilization regarding ethnic and racial identities during\nthe last two decades involving strong youth elements. As with gender and masculin-\nities, more research is needed on indigenous and Afrodescendant youth, but also on\nwhite and mestizo youth: what do these characteristics mean today, how have they\nchanged or continued, and how do these shape youth politics? \n\nFurthermore, across subfields, scholars must reconsider politics in light of\nchanges emerging from new youth practices. Theoretically and empirically, Latin\nAmerican youth politics fuse previously assumed dichotomies, thereby urging schol-\nars to move beyond the binary categorizations of politics as either traditional, formal,\nand institutional or new, informal, and noninstitutionalized. We propose the devel-\nopment of more useful conceptual tools to ask open questions about politics, not just\namong youth but in the larger society. Looking to youth\u2019s new practices and mean-\nings to forge the path forward, some possibilities emerge from our review: politicizing\npractices or politics embedded in practice; building networks through the digital and\nthe physical combined; merging personal issues around sexuality, cultural expression,\neducational access, and physical security with questions about the social organization\nof movements; and drawing from globalized technologies and repertoires to make\nsense of local issues (a different kind of reterritorialization). \n\nThe horizontality of how youth come to politics\u2014individually and digitally\u2014\ntranslates into their desire for different arrangements in organized political forms\nwhereby the individual shapes mass movements, rather than a selected vanguard\nthat changes individuals\u2019 lives. Instead of seeing youth practices and meanings as\nproblematic, our review suggests that scholars should examine these for their poten-\ntial to be emancipatory and to signal new directions of social change.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback, as well as Ana-\nCara Fernandes and Joshua Duden for their research assistance.
