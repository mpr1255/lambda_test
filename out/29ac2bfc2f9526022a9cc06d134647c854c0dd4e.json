Pruitt, London,\nRowman & Littlefield International, 2017, 147 pp., index, \u00a380.00 (hardback), ISBN\n978-1-7834-8993-0, \u00a324.95 (paperback), ISBN 978-1-7834-8995-4\n\nYoung people around the world are voting less and fewer among the new generations\nconsider democracy as the best political system to rule the society they live in. While the\nupper echelons of the political world scream blue murder, little has been said about how\nyoung people are engaging in different, new kinds of democratic processes. Why are\nyoung people not participating in the electoral process? \u201cThey do not vote because\nthey do not see it as an effective way of getting what they want\u201d (9). However, if\nyoung people are engaging in their own way of politics, why is it important to success-\nfully implement civics education in schools? Because \u201ccitizenship education provides\nyoung people with an opportunity to learn about what it means to live in a democracy\u201d\n(56). Therefore, the question this book addresses is how should young people be\nincluded and motivated to engage in the different rituals of democracy? For the\nauthors of this book, the answer to this last question lies in the \u201cpractice of co-designing\ncivics education with a broad, representative sample of young people\u201d (xi, emphasis in\noriginal) in which policymakers should engage regularly in order to increase younger\ngenerations\u2019 democratic participation.\n\nCo-designing the civics education programmes, the authors argue, will take young\npeople from citizens in the making to full citizens. Moving away from a \u201cstate-\nknows-best\u201d approach, it makes sense that those who would be the most affected by\na public policy get the greatest say during the design of the curriculum for the\ncourses and activities they will participate in during their formative years. A co-\ndesign approach in education policies promotes a dialogue between policymakers\nand citizens. Moreover, with \u201cmore first-hand interactions with the subjects of their\nanalysis [\u2026] policymakers and curriculum experts unlock the potential to co-\nproduce with young people a curriculum that is more in tune with the lived realities\nof today\u2019s young people rather than merely replicating unhelpful stereotypes\u201d (132).\nWhat young people think of the civic education they get at school and how this type\nof education better relates to and accounts for what younger generations understand\nfor citizenship are questions that should guide policymakers if they truly wish to\nachieve a full understanding of what is currently happening with our youth. And\nthey should do so, because \u201cthere is nothing to suggest that young people cannot\nmake an invaluable, engaged and considered political contribution\u201d (131).\n\nChapter by chapter, the authors make the case to revitalize and rethink the impor-\ntance of citizenship education. In her chapter, Catherine Hartung argues that, \u201cwithout\ncritically engaging with the taken-for-grantedness of citizenship and citizenship edu-\ncation, we run the risk of reproducing rather than overcoming social and political\ninequality and disengagement\u201d (67). However, the empirical cases in the book focus\non the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and its conclusions are\n\nDEMOCRATIZATION\n2019, VOL. 26, NO. 2, 343\u2013357\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com\n\n\nlimited to these contexts. By focusing on only three countries, this study excludes how\nyounger generations in different regions around the world, such as Europe and South\nAmerica, are effectively engaging in traditional politics, even when they do not have\naccess to civic education programmes in schools.\n\nPerhaps the biggest strength of this book is the simplicity and clarity with which the\nauthors tackle the persistent paradox in the literature about democracy and youth; that\nis, the dichotomic views on whether the younger generations\u2019 disengagement from tra-\nditional politics is hindering democracy or expanding it. The crisis of democracy has\nlong been considered the result of younger generations\u2019 abandonment and dispassio-\nnateness for traditional politics. On the contrary, and drawing on Pierre Rosanvallon\u2019s\ntheory of \u201ccounter-democracy\u201d, the authors argue that the plurality of democracy con-\nceptions within a society clash with each other in a constant process of balancing.\nIndeed, as it is argued throughout this volume, there are many ways of doing politics,\nas there are many ways of being political. As Chou points out in the chapter that opens\nthis volume, \u201csimply voting at national elections is no longer politically sufficient\u201d (18).\nThis puts tensions on the sacralisation of certain political acts, and down the road,\nmakes traditional politicians nervous. However, and here is the crux of the matter,\nyoung people are not simply going home. Rather, they \u201care rejecting, refining as well\nas revolutionising politics\u201d (19).\n\nBy the end of the volume, the main question of whether or not implementing co-\ndesigned civics education curriculums in schools will improve the younger generations\u2019\nparticipation in traditional politics remains unanswered. The authors have made a good\ncase of demystifying what the younger generations\u2019 lack of participation actually means,\nand shows how the youth can inform policymakers and policymakers can inform the\nyouth through co-designed civics education programmes. On the other hand, the\nauthors have not shown any definitive proof through data that co-created programmes\nwill single-handedly alleviate the youth\u2019s disengagement in politics. Yet, this book\nremains a recommendable invitation to anyone who wonders what will happen when\ntoday\u2019s youth become tomorrow\u2019s voters.\n\nTom\u00e1s Dodds\nLeiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands\n\nt.dodds.rojas@fsw.leidenuniv.nl http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4724-5307\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tom\u00e1s Dodds\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2018.1490725\n\nHow democracy ends, by David Runciman, London, Profile Books, 2018, 249\npp., index, \u00a314.99 (hardback), \u00a312.99 (ebook), ISBN 978-1781259740\n\nIt is common knowledge that democracy is in decline. From the high point of the\nimmediate post-Cold War period until around the late 1990s or early 2000s, democracy\nseemed to be on the up. Fukuyama identified the late 1980s as the \u201cend of history\u201d with\nliberal democracy unchallenged by alternative political systems. When we are all demo-\ncrats now, it seems that the only way to go is down.
