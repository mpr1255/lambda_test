WILLIAMS, KATSUNORI SEKI AND GUY D. WHITTEN\n\nA lthough a voluminous literature has shed light on the relationship between economic condi-\ntions and government accountability, most studies in this literature have implicitly assumed\nthat the actions of competing political parties are either irrelevant or that they cancel each\n\nother out. In this paper, we take an important first step toward relaxing this strong assumption.\nWe develop and test a set of theoretical propositions from the issue competition literature about\nthe amount of emphasis that parties place on the economy during election campaigns. We test\nthese propositions with an estimation technique that properly situates the motivations of rival\nelites within the context of spatial party competition using a spatial autoregressive model. On a\nsample of 22 advanced democracies from 1957 to 2006, we find strong support for the proposi-\ntion that parties with a greater role in economic policymaking respond to worsening economic\nconditions by increasing their emphasis on the economy during election campaigns. We also\nfind strong evidence of spatial contagion effects as parties respond positively to the campaign\nstrategies of ideologically proximate parties. This finding reveals a fundamental link in the chain\nof economic accountability and has important implications for the study of party competition.\n\nAcross nations and over time, scholars have consistently demonstrated that the state of\nthe economy remains one of the most salient factors in elections (Singer 2011). As a\nresult, a large literature has focused on modeling the influence of economic factors on\n\nsupport for competing teams of political elites (for recent reviews of the literature on economic\nvoting, see Hibbs 2006; Anderson 2007; Stegmaier and Lewis-Beck 2013). Although we now\nhave a much better understanding of how the economy influences election outcomes, one key\ncomponent of this theoretical picture that has been missing is the role of political elites in\nattempting to shape economic voting. Researchers of economic voting have assumed that\npolitical elites are either passive actors or actors whose efforts to shape economic voting cancel\neach other out and can thus be safely relegated to the error term in empirical models of voting\nbehavior. In this paper, we relax and test this assumption by developing a model of elite\nemphasis on the economy during election campaigns.\n\nWe begin with a simple question: \u201cwhat determines how much political parties talk about the\neconomy during campaigns?\u201d We develop a theoretical model of how economic conditions,\ngovernment status, and ideological competition shape the emphasis on economic issues\n\n* Laron K.

As economic conditions worsen, the economy eclipses other issues as the\nmost important issue facing the nation at that time. As economic performance is closely tied to\nvoters\u2019 valence assessments of parties as well as electoral fortunes in general, all parties have an\nincentive to shift their focus to emphasizing the economy. The degree of party responsiveness to\neconomic performance, however, depends on the party\u2019s role in government and the strategies\nchosen by ideologically similar parties.\n\nWe first provide a brief overview of the relevant literatures, focusing on how they connect the\nsalience of an issue to elite strategies of campaign emphasis. On a sample of 22 advanced\ndemocracies from 1957 to 2006, we test these theoretical expectations and present empirical\nfindings that demonstrate the influence of economic conditions, government status, and spatial\ncompetition on party campaign strategies in advanced democracies. We then conclude with a\ndiscussion of the broader implications of our findings for theories of economic and valence\nvoting, as well as a set of promising areas for future research.\n\nLITERATURE\n\nThere is a wealth of literature that addresses why parties emphasize certain issues at the expense\nof others (e.g., Carmines and Stimson 1989; Petrocik 1996). Prominent theories of issue\nsaliency (Budge and Farlie 1983) and issue ownership (Petrocik 1996) suggest that certain\nissues are \u201cowned\u201d by specific parties\u2014meaning that the party is able to handle that issue better\nthan other parties\u2014and that parties will attempt to elevate these issues on the agenda through\nemphasis during campaigns. Other parties recognize that competing on these dimensions is a\nlosing strategy, so they emphasize an entirely different issue where they perceive an electoral\nadvantage. For these scholars, party competition can be characterized as one of \u201cavoidance\u201d\nrather than \u201cengagement\u201d (Sigelman and Buell 2004).\n\nRecent theories have questioned the prevalence of avoidance techniques and have provided\nevidence that parties often directly engage other parties on the same issues (e.g., Sigelman and\nBuell 2004). As economic conditions worsen, they become more salient in the political land-\nscape: \u201cEither a slowdown of growth or an increase in unemployment results in more citizens\nsaying that the economy is important. Volatile economies also seem to heighten voter uncer-\ntainty and increase their attention to economic issues\u201d (Singer 2011, 301; see also Singer 2013).\nFor those issues with a high degree of salience, such as a poorly performing economy,\nparties feel pressure from mass media and their own supporters to face these issues head on\n(Green-Pedersen and Mortensen 2010). Even if an issue might be \u201cowned\u201d by another party\n(e.g., Petrocik 1996), \u201cthe actual state of the world may make certain issues unavoidable\u201d\n(Budge and Farlie 1983, 129). Thus, vote-maximizing parties cannot afford to ignore these\nsalient economic issues: \u201cto try to do so is to risk failing to make an appeal to new voters and to\ndishearten older supporters by displaying the party\u2019s irrelevance to modern developments\u201d\n(Klingemann, Hofferbert and Budge 1994, 29).\n\nThese studies suggest that elites have a wide range of potential strategies available when\nconfronting issues of limited salience to the electorate (e.g., Green and Hobolt 2008). Economic\nperformance is likely unique in this respect. When economic performance is poor, avoiding the\nissue seems like a risky strategy for two reasons. First, \u201cit is virtually a universal belief among\npoliticians, political commentators, and even voters that elections are referenda on the\neconomy\u201d (Duch and Stevenson 2008, 1). Without directly engaging the opponent on matters of\nhigh salience, the party gives up the ability to prime the issue in voters\u2019 minds (Lenz 2012)\nand structure the debate in a favorable way (Jerit 2008). Given the clear connection between\neconomic performance and electoral fortunes (Powell and Whitten 1993; Anderson 1995;\n\n48 WILLIAMS, SEKI AND WHITTEN\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\nDuch and Stevenson 2008), we would expect that both opposition and government parties\nwould increase their emphasis of economic issues during instances of poor performance;\nwhereas opposition parties would want to blame the government for the problems, the\ngovernment parties would want to shift blame to other actors (e.g., Weaver 1986).\n\nSecond, economic performance can offer one of many basic heuristics that voters can use to\ndecide how to vote (Stokes 1963), by influencing one\u2019s perceptions of the party that \u201ccan best\ndeliver economic \u2018good times\u2019 \u201d (Clarke et al. 2009, 31; see also Whiteley 1984). As economic\nperformance worsens and the economy becomes more salient, it becomes easier for voters to\nevaluate parties based on performance (Krosnick 1990) and increases the effects of evaluations\non vote choice (Fournier et al. 2003; Green and Hobolt 2008). Indeed, there is evidence that\nparties respond to the shifting salience of issues to voters by emphasizing those issues during a\ncampaign (Hobolt and Klemmensen 2008; Spoon, Hobolt and De Vries 2013).\n\nThus, when we think about how the relative salience of an issue influences emphasis, we\narrive at the expectation that parties should emphasize the economy more in order to establish\ntheir credentials as the party best able to deal with the problems going forward, to shore up their\nleadership credentials, and to hold on to their core voters or party identifiers. When facing the\nelectorate during times of relative economic prosperity, when less of the electorate is likely to\nsee the economy as the most important issue facing the nation, governing elites are likely to\nemphasize whatever other issues are more salient for voters and thus put less emphasis on\neconomic issues. If we think about the incentives facing opposition politicians, we have\nexpectations that mirror those for governing politicians\u2014they should emphasize the economy\nmore when it is doing poorly and less when economic conditions are better. As opposed to\ngovernment parties, opposition parties have more flexibility in terms of emphasizing issues that\nare not necessarily on the party-system agenda (Green-Pedersen and Mortensen 2010).\n\nFrom the preceding discussion, we have the expectation that all parties should increase their\ncampaign emphasis on the economy when economic performance has been poor and voter\nattention is likely to be focused on selecting the best parties to deal with the salient issue. We\nexpect this tendency to be especially strong among governing parties and, in particular, those\ngoverning parties with a larger role in economic policymaking (such as the Finance Minister\nand Prime Minister). As these are the parties that the economic voting literature has shown us\nare most likely to be punished for poor economic performances, they have the most explaining\nto do in order to convince the electorate that they will be the best managers of the economy\nmoving forward. Furthermore, Green-Pedersen and Mortensen (2010) show that government\nparties are more constrained than opposition parties by having to respond to the salient issues of\nthe day, such as subpar economic performance. In addition to economic performance and\ngovernment status, another relevant concern for competing elites is the campaign emphasis of\ntheir ideological neighbors.\n\nUnlike economic voting and valence voting models, spatial models of party competition\n(Downs 1957; Grofman 1985; Rabinowitz and Macdonald 1989) explicitly recognize that party\nstrategies are the result of careful planning by elites. In spatial models of voting, scholars\nportray party and voter ideological placements as the main drivers of vote choice, and economic\nand other valence issues, if they include them, are usually seen as mere sideshows (e.g., Adams\n2001; Schofield and Sened 2006). Although the literature on spatial party competition suggests\nthat some parties may be slow to respond to shifts in public opinion or changing economic\nconditions (e.g., Adams, Haupt and Stoll 2009), the economic voting literature highlights the\nincentives that parties have to respond quickly to economic concerns. Leaders are strategic and\ncarefully craft their messages to maximize votes; this means staying within their \u201cideologically\ndelimited\u201d space (Adams 2001; see also Budge 1994), but modifying their position enough to\n\nEconomic Conditions and Party Strategy 49\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\nappeal to non-partisans. At the same time, there is convincing evidence that parties respond to\nshifts by rival parties (Adams and Somer-Topcu 2009), alter their strategies based on concerns\nof electoral vulnerability triggered by issues owned by more extreme parties (e.g., Meguid\n2005; Spoon, Hobolt and De Vries 2013), and emphasize similar issues as ideologically\nproximate parties (Vliegenthart, Walgrave and Meppelink 2011). Indeed, Williams and\nWhitten\u2019s (2015) theory of spatial contagion effects argues that voters hold ideologically similar\nparties accountable for poor economic performance.\n\nSpatial models typically assume that any crafting of strategy will be reflected in movement of\nthe parties\u2019 positions on a left\u2013right scale. However, this does not have to be the case, especially\nwhen dealing with more specific issues like the economy. In addition to the option of parties\nshifting to the left or right (e.g., Tavits 2007; Hellwig 2012), there is the possibility of turning\nup the volume of the message that they are delivering. Regardless of whether we are thinking\nabout a strategy of changing position or changing the degree of emphasis of a particular issue\narea, spatial models of party competition focus on the movement of cut points between\nideologically proximate parties and the resulting shifts in party support. Thus, the main\nexpectation derived from the literature on spatial competition is that parties will craft their\nmessages to voters based on what the other parties in their ideological neighborhood are doing.1\n\nA MODEL OF PARTY CAMPAIGN EMPHASIS ON THE ECONOMY\n\nPulling together the insights from the literature on issue competition discussed in the previous\nsection, we derive the following theoretical propositions about how economic performance,\ngovernment status, and ideological positioning come together to influence campaign emphasis:\n\nPROPOSITION 1: All parties, opposition and government, will emphasize the economy more\nwhen conditions are poor and less when conditions are good.\n\nPROPOSITION 2: These effects will be stronger for government parties with a larger role in\neconomic policymaking.\n\nPROPOSITION 3: The economic emphasis of spatially proximate parties will be positively\ncorrelated.\n\nAlthough fairly standard linear model specifications can test the expectations from Propo-\nsitions 1 and 2, they cannot test the expectations from Proposition 3. As outlined above, this\nexpectation is that in a given election, each party\u2019s level of campaign emphasis on the economy\nwill be influenced by what the other parties in their ideological neighborhood are doing. This\ntype of theoretical expectation is best tested in a spatial autoregressive (SAR from here on)\nmodel (Franzese and Hays 2007; Plumper and Neumayer 2010 provide overviews of the\napplication of this class of models to political science data).\n\nWe specify an empirical model to test our theoretical propositions as follows:\n\nYijt \u00bc \u03c1WY +\u03d5Yijt\ufffd1 + \u03b20 + \u03b21Ejt + \u03b22\u00f0Ejt \u00b4Gijt\u00de + cijt\u03b3 + \u03f5ijt;\n1 It is worth noting that, in this paper, these expectations are the same across parties, regardless of gov-\n\nernment status. In future work, we intend to relax this assumption and allow for the possibility that parties react\ndifferently to the behavior of other parties depending on their government/opposition status and the status of the\nparties in their ideological neighborhood.\n\n50 WILLIAMS, SEKI AND WHITTEN\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\nwhere Yijt is the economic campaign emphasis by party i in nation j during election t; W a\nweights matrix containing the ideological distances between each pair of parties in each nation\nin each election; Ejt a measure of economic performance in nation j at time t; Gijt a measure of\nwhether or not party i is a part of the government of nation j at the time of election t (Seki and\nWilliams 2014);2 cijt a vector of control variables measuring other relevant characteristics of\nparty i in nation j at time t; \u03c1 the spatial parameter that connects different predicted values\nof Yijt, Y\u0302ijt , across observations based on W; \u03d5, \u03b20, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b3 are parameters, or in the case of\n\u03b3 vectors of parameters, that connect independent variable values to predicted values of Yijt, also\nknown as pre-spatial predicted values of the dependent variable; and \u03f5ijt a stochastic\ndisturbance term.\n\nAlthough this model specification is fairly complex, it is worth noting that it glosses over a\nnumber of additional measurement issues that we discuss in the following section; however, for\nnow, we can summarize the theoretical claims that we have using this model. As the discussion\nabove emphasizes, our expectations about the impact of economic performance on campaign\nemphasis are pretty straightforward. If we think of Ejt as being an economic performance\nmeasure for which higher values indicate worse performance, our expectation is that increases\nin Ejt will lead to increase in economic emphasis for all parties (\u03b21> 0). Given the strong\nexpectations that voters will punish governing parties for poor economic performances,\ngoverning parties may emphasize the economy even more when the economy is doing poorly to\nconvince voters that, despite the current conditions, they are still the best choice for handling the\nproblems facing their nation (\u03b22> 0).\n\nThe expectation of a spatial voting effect (theoretical Proposition 3) works through the expected\nemphasis of other political parties, depending on their ideological proximities (as measured in the\nW matrix). This type of expectation\u2014that the level of economic emphasis by ideologically\nproximate parties will influence their neighbors\u2014is known as an expectation of positive spatial\nautocorrelation (\u03c1> 0). What this means is that for each pair of parties competing in the election in\nnation j at time t, holding all other factors constant, we expect economic emphasis to be positively\nand more strongly correlated when the two parties are ideologically closer to each other. As\nideological distance increases, this correlation should approach 0.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN\n\nIn order to test the model presented in the previous section, we needed to gather data on party\ncompetition that maximized the variation in economic circumstances, as well as the distribution\nof political parties in terms of ideology over time. More specifically, we required longitudinal,\ncross-national measures of the extent to which parties emphasize economic issues in their\nelection campaigns. The Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) fulfills these requirements by\ncontent analyzing the statements in parties\u2019 election manifestos and categorizing them based on\nissue emphasis (Budge et al. 2001). The manifestos are an authoritative statement made by each\nparty regarding long-term policy goals and thus represent an ideal data source for this project.3\n\n2 As we discuss further below, we also estimated some models in which we use a coding of this variable that\nidentifies the party of the PM and or FM compared with all other parties. Ideally, we would have liked to have\nbeen able to estimate models in which there were simultaneously dummy variables identifying both government\nparties and the party of the PM and/or FM; however, because of the interactive nature of our model specifications\nand constraints on the amount of variation in key variables, we were unable to efficiently estimate these models\nwith the current data.\n\n3 The manifestos are often written months, if not years, in advance of the election (Adams and Somer-Topcu\n2009, 832). Since we do not have more dynamic data measuring economic emphasis throughout the campaign,\n\nEconomic Conditions and Party Strategy 51\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\nStarting with these data, we assembled a data set of 22 advanced parliamentary democracies in\npost-World War II era (ranging from 1957 to 2006). We selected these 22 democracies because\nthey have established party systems and have been democratic for a good portion of the post-\nWorld War II era.4\n\nTo create our economic emphasis variable (Yijt in the model specification), we take the sum of\nall the categories in the Economy domain (Domain 4) divided by the total percentage of quasi-\nsentences (including uncoded quasi-sentences). All the 16 categories in this domain focus on\neconomic issues ranging from mentions of economic planning to Marxist analysis and\nKeynesian demand management. By summing the categories, we can get a sense of the overall\nemphasis on economic issues in parties\u2019 campaigns without having to justify arbitrary place-\nment of the categories into ideological divisions. In order to control for unexplained hetero-\ngeneity across countries, we constructed our measure as the deviation from the average value\nacross time and parties for each nation. As we expect that previous campaign strategies exercise\na strong influence on current party strategies (Aldrich 1983; Somer-Topcu 2009), we include\neconomic emphasisijt \u2212 1, which captures the level of economic emphasis by each party in the\nprevious election. The inclusion of economic emphasisijt \u2212 1 is key to our modeling strategy, as it\nmeans that we are modeling how much parties have deviated from their usual strategy in terms\nof economic emphasis based on the variables of theoretical interest. In addition, in order to\ncontrol for possible temporal patterns in economic emphasis within nations that operate above\nand beyond what might be going on in terms of objective economic performance and the other\nmeasures of theoretical interest, we include a measure of the average economic emphasisjt\u2212 1.\nThis variable measures the average economic emphasis by all of the other parties in the previous\nelection.\n\nIn order to take into account the relative ideological placement of all parties in an election, we\ncreated a spatial weights matrix (W in the model specification) that contains the ideological\ndistances between each pair of parties in each nation in each election. Elements in this matrix\nrepresenting pairs of parties from different nations or different elections within the same nation\ntake on values of 0 in this matrix. For ease of interpretation, we constructed our measure of\ndistance between each pair such that higher values indicate a pair of parties that are closer to\neach other ideologically.5\n\nResearchers using economic voting models have employed a variety of different measures to\noperationalize economic performance (Ejt in the model specification). The three most popular of\nthese measures are growth, inflation, and unemployment. We include real GDP per capita\ngrowth (taken from the Penn World Table Version 7.0, Heston, Summers and Aten 2011), the\none-month lag of unemployment and the one-quarter lag of inflation (both from OECD).\n\nThe economic voting literature has differed substantially in how it measures parties in\ngovernment and thus accountability for economic performances. On the one hand, some\nscholars (e.g., Powell and Whitten 1993; Palmer and Whitten 1999) have made a case for\nclassifying any party that held at least one cabinet seat at the time of an election as a governing\n\n(F\u2019note continued)\n\nwe are left to argue that parties simultaneously respond to and anticipate the strategies of other parties regarding\neconomic emphasis within manifestos.\n\n4 More details on the cases covered in this study are provided in the Additional Materials document.\n5 Therefore, our weights matrix contains the inverse of the absolute distance between parties based on their\n\nleft\u2013right score. In order to avoid contamination with our dependent variable, we recalculated the usual left\u2013right\nscore without any of the measures used in the construction of our economic emphasis variable. Note that across\nour sample of cases the correlation between these \u201cpurged\u201d ideological scores and the standard manifesto left\u2013\nright measure is 0.92 (p-value< 0.001).\n\n52 WILLIAMS, SEKI AND WHITTEN\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\nparty, expecting their electoral fortunes to rise or fall accordingly. On the other, there are\nscholars (e.g., Duch and Stevenson 2008) who view only the party of the PM as the theore-\ntically relevant party for the purposes of economic accountability.6 For our purposes, we\nestimated our models with several different operationalizations of party government status, each\ninteracted with the three economic variables. We present three of these specifications below.7\n\nIn addition to the main variables of theoretical interest, we included a series of control\nvariables based on the extant literature on party competition (cijt in the model specification). As\noutlined above, we model our main theoretical expectation about the influence of party ideology\non economic emphasis using a spatial weights matrix. An extensive literature has identified a\nnumber of characteristics that appear to shape the strategic thinking of political parties (e.g.,\nMeguid 2005; Adams et al. 2006). One contribution of this literature has been to identify\nfamilies of parties that, regardless of their ideological location, have strong bonds to particular\nconstituencies, which might shape their manifesto messages. In order to account for this, we\nhave included a measure of the average family economic emphasisjt \u2212 1.\n\n8 To further capture the\ntendency for more centrist parties to emphasize economic issues in an effort to appeal to more\nvoters, we include the absolute purged left\u2013right score (the typical left\u2013right score from the\nCMP with the economic categories removed). We expect that large values, indicating parties\nfurther to the left or right, will result in lower values of economic emphasis. This part of the\nliterature has also identified a set of \u201cniche\u201d parties (typically environmental and far-left parties)\nthat appear to care more about a particular ideological position or the emphasis of a single\ndefining issue than they do about winning votes (Meguid 2005). We follow the conventional\nprocedure of identifying these parties in our models with a dummy variable. Finally, we include\neach party\u2019s previous vote share (vote sharet \u2212 1) to control for efforts by larger parties to\nemphasize broader issues such as the economy.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRecall that we theorize that parties, and in particular government parties, will respond to\nworsening economic conditions by emphasizing the economy more.9 These expectations occur\nwithin the context of party competition, and the spatial literature suggests that parties will\nrespond to economic conditions in a similar fashion as their ideological rivals. Table 1 shows\nthe estimates for three SAR models of economic emphasis. Model 1 uses a simple dichotomous\nvariable (called government party) to distinguish those parties controlling government portfo-\nlios from those that do not. Model 2 uses a continuous variable (government seats) from 0 to 1\nthat weights the percentage of government seats that each party controls (a value of 0 indicates\n\n6 They based this assessment on extensive evidence showing that \u201cwhatever the overall size of the negative\neconomic vote in an election, most of it goes to the prime ministerial party\u2014no matter whether the opposition,\nother cabinet partners, or both also get a negative economic vote\u201d (Duch and Stevenson 2008, 269).\n\n7 We present other methods of conceptualizing government accountability in the Additional Materials\ndocument.\n\n8 Those parties with no family members in the previous election have a value of 0.\n9 Another implication of our theory is that government and opposition parties respond differently to\n\neconomic conditions in terms of ideological shifts because voters typically discount the promises made by\ngovernment parties (Bawn and Somer-Topcu 2012). Indeed, we find that parties that face punishment for\nworsening economic conditions shift their positions toward the ideological extreme. Opposition parties, on the\nother hand, shift toward the center when faced with worsening economic conditions. These results are available\nin the Additional Materials document.

As we include these in the model specification\ninteractively, we can get a good initial assessment of the estimated substantive effects by\nexamining the pre-spatial marginal effects (for Model 1) in Table 2. This table provides the pre-\nspatial marginal effects (and 95 percent confidence intervals) of economic conditions for parties\nbased on accountability (opposition and government parties) on the emphasis of economic\nissues. Holding everything else constant, government parties respond to worsening unem-\nployment and inflation by emphasizing the economy more (statistically significant at the\n95 percent confidence level). The marginal effects of economic growth are in the expected\nnegative direction, but are not statistically significant. On the other hand, opposition parties do\nnot respond to economic conditions by modifying their average level of economic emphasis,\nthough the pre-spatial marginal effects for opposition parties are, as expected, in the same\ndirection as those for government parties. These results provide moderately strong support for\nour first theoretical proposition and strong support for our second theoretical proposition.\n\nThe next two models allow us to assess whether responsiveness to economic conditions\nvaries based on the percentage of government seats controlled by each party (Model 2) or party\ncontrol over the commanding heights of economic policymaking (Model 3). We depict the\nmarginal effects of unemployment and inflation on economic emphasis in the two panels of\nFigure 1. Figure 1 shows that the extent to which a party responds to unemployment and\ninflation depends on whether the party is a part of government, and what percentage of\ngovernment seats that party controls. Although the estimated effects for opposition parties\n(i.e., when government percentage equals 0) are in the expected positive direction, they are not\nstatistically significant. In both of the panels in Figure 1, we see evidence that, as a party\ncontrols a higher percentage of government seats, they are much more responsive to worsening\neconomic conditions.11 The estimated relationships for real GDP per capita growth are in the\nexpected negative direction but are not statistically significant.12\n\nFigure 2 shows the responsiveness of four categories of parties (based on which positions in\ngovernment they controlled) to unemployment and inflation.13 For both economic variables,\n\nTABLE 2 Pre-Spatial Marginal Effects for Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation Across\nGovernment Status\n\nX Variables Z Variables Marginal Effect\n\nReal GDP per capita growth Opposition \u22120.142 [\u22120.365, 0.081]\nGovernment \u22120.199 [\u22120.583, 0.185]\n\nUnemployment Opposition 0.059 [\u22120.064, 0.182]\nGovernment 0.311 [0.062, 0.560]**\n\nInflation Opposition 0.029 [\u22120.109, 0.168]\nGovernment 0.266 [0.032, 0.500]**\n\nNote: marginal effects reported are \u03b2X + (\u03b2XZ\u00d7 Z)|Z = 1.

As this involved the estimation of a substantial number of interaction terms, we lumped\ntogether opposition parties and government parties that did not control either the FM or PM.\n\nEconomic Conditions and Party Strategy 55\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\ncontrolling the finance ministry appears to be a more important determinant of economic\nemphasis than controlling the PM.

For example, the effects of\nunemployment on economic emphasis depend on the strength of the spatial autocorrelation (\u03c1),\nthe pattern of interconnectivities between parties (W), and the amount of economic emphasis by\nall the parties in the system for that election (which is a function of X\u03b2). We expect that strategic\nparty emphasis of economic issues will be a function of what rival parties are doing, how those\nparties are connected, and the strength of that connection.\n\nTo better assess the substantive effects of Model 1 (Table 1) and the interactive effects\n(Table 2), we generate the marginal effect of a 1 SD increase in unemployment (+3.83 percent)\nfor a government party.

In the bottom half, we provide five\notherwise identical scenarios in terms of the distribution of parties from left to right (parties are\nlocated at \u221240, \u221215, 0, 15, and 40). In each scenario, we vary the values of economic emphasis\nfor the government\u2019s two most ideologically proximate parties (at \u221215 and 15) with lines to the\nleft (representing less than average economic emphasis) and lines to the right (representing\ngreater than average economic emphasis).16\n\nTo interpret the results displayed in this figure, we suggest starting with the middle scenario,\nwhich represents an election in which all five parties are emphasizing the economy to an\naverage extent, and working to the outside. As the value of economic emphasis for all parties in\nthis scenario is set to 0, there is no spatial lag effect and the post-spatial marginal effect is\nequivalent to the pre-spatial marginal effect.17 If we examine the scenario to the immediate left,\nin which the two ideologically proximate parties emphasize the economy a little less, we can see\nthe influence of our estimated \u03c1. In this scenario, the spatial contagion effects on the govern-\nment party cause it to emphasize the economy less.

These spatial contagion\neffects are more pronounced in the first and last scenarios depicted in this figure, where the\nrival parties\u2019 strategies involve a considerable de-emphasis or emphasis, respectively, on the\neconomy. Scenarios such as these induce robust responses by the government party in terms of\nits economic emphasis.\n\nOf course, the tendency for the government party to be responsive to the behavior of other\nparties depends on their relative proximity. We account for this behavior by weighting the\nimpact of each party in the weights matrix by the inverse of their absolute distance from each\nother. As expected, the behavior of the most distant parties leads to smaller responses from the\ngovernment party than the behavior of more proximate parties. In Figure 4, we demonstrate\nhow moderating the values of economic emphasis for the two ideologically distant parties\n(at \u221240 and 40) influences the government party\u2019s response to worsening unemployment. In\nFigure 4, we see that changes in campaign strategies by more distant parties have a minimal\nimpact on the government party. As the government party is unlikely to be directly competing\nwith these parties for the support of undecided voters, it is largely unmoved by even substantial\nchanges in their campaign strategies. These two figures together demonstrate the utility of\nevaluating the effects of economic conditions on campaign strategies within the context of the\nspatial environment in which parties are competing.\n\nThe control variables in our models work largely as expected. Larger parties (represented by\nhigh values of votet \u2212 1) and more centrist parties (represented by low values of absolute purged\nleft\u2013right score) emphasize the economy more.

Thus, it is somewhat surprising that the vast majority of research on the influence\nof the economy on election outcomes have ignored the efforts of elites. An important first step\nfor understanding these linkages is the development of theories about how elites shape their\nmessages.\n\nThis paper represents a first effort to develop a general theory that explains the degree to\nwhich strategic parties emphasize economic concerns in their election manifestos. We derive\ntheoretical expectations about the emphasis of economic issues in manifestos based on the\nincreased salience of the economy during tough economic times. Our results indicate strong\nsupport for our theoretical propositions. Rather than running away from poor economic\nperformances, governing parties talk about the economy more during bad economic times\nbecause of its high level of relative salience. The degree to which they do so depends on their\nrole in economic policymaking and the behavior of their ideological neighbors.\n\nThese findings have important implications for economic voting, spatial models of party\ncompetition, and valence voting. First, this study raises questions about the absence of strategic\nelites in studies of economic voting (see Hellwig 2012 for a notable exception). By omitting any\nmeasures of the strategic activity by competing elites, these actions are implicitly assumed to\neither not matter or to always cancel each other out. If the tendency of voters to hold\ngovernment parties accountable for poor economic performance is a function of the portrayal of\neconomic conditions by elites during the campaign process, then our findings suggest that we\nmust first explore the impetus for parties to emphasize the economy. Our paper indicates that\nparties are purposive in making the economy a more or less salient issue in election campaigns.\nTherefore, it is likely that the processes by which parties strategize about salient issues and the\nmanner in which voters hold parties accountable are intricately linked. Studies evaluating one or\nthe other must carefully consider how strategic parties (both in government and in opposition)\ncan attempt to mitigate or exacerbate the economic vote.\n\nSecond, if formal models of party competition intend to produce general theories of strategic\nbehavior, then they should consider taking issue salience and other valence concerns more\nseriously. Voting models based on the relative distance between voters and parties can only go\nso far in explaining voters\u2019 decisionmaking. This study suggests that spatial models should\nstrive to incorporate valence assessments, which other scholars have found to have high\nexplanatory power (Clarke et al. 2004). Although it may not be immediately obvious how to\nincorporate features such as perceived competence or assessments about which party is the best\neconomic manager into spatial models, scholars have shown that this can be done (e.g., Adams\n2001). This project demonstrates that party strategy is a function of both valence considerations\nand relative ideological proximity.\n\nThe final implication pertains to valence voting. Rather than campaigning on issues other\nthan the economy during hard economic times, government parties emphasize the economy\nmore. As interesting as these results are from a valence perspective, they do not tell the\ncomplete story. We still do not know, for example, how the content of economic emphasis\nvaries in response to economic conditions for the government parties versus other parties. For\nexample, is the increased emphasis a result of parties offering alternative potential solutions to\nthe economic problems in an attempt to change voters\u2019 perceptions of which party would be the\n\n60 WILLIAMS, SEKI AND WHITTEN\n\nht\ntp\n\ns:\n//\n\ndo\ni.o\n\nrg\n/1\n\n0.\n10\n\n17\n/p\n\nsr\nm\n\n.2\n01\n\n5.\n13\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne.\n A\n\nus\ntr\n\nal\nia\n\nn \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl U\n\nni\nve\n\nrs\nity\n\n, o\nn \n\n22\n Ju\n\nl 2\n02\n\n1 \nat\n\n 0\n3:\n\n23\n:0\n\n5,\n s\n\nub\nje\n\nct\n to\n\n th\ne \n\nCa\nm\n\nbr\nid\n\nge\n C\n\nor\ne \n\nte\nrm\n\ns \nof\n\n u\nse\n\n, a\nva\n\nila\nbl\n\ne \nat\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n://\n\nw\nw\n\nw\n.c\n\nam\nbr\n\nid\nge\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/c\nor\n\ne/\nte\n\nrm\ns.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2015.13\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms\n\n\nmost competent economic manager moving forward? Or is the increased emphasis a result of\ngovernment parties trying to improve voters\u2019 assessments of leader images?
