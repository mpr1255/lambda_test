Hot Science, High Water: Assembling Nature, Society and Environmental\nPolicy in Contemporary Vietnam. Copenhagen: NIAS Press.\n\nReviewed by Jennifer Wallace\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park\n\nVietnam is among the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change,\nbased on its predicted land losses from sea-level rise and the population density\nwithin these areas. Given the magnitude of this problem, conventional wisdom\nsuggests that a coordinated effort to address this threat to Vietnam\u2019s popula-\ntion and economy is in the best interest of both local and global actors. If the\ninterests of Vietnamese citizens, the national government, and international\ndevelopment practitioners fail to align on this issue, what hope is there for these\nactors to make inroads on more contentious global issues such as democratiza-\ntion or human rights? Eren Zink\u2019s Hot Science, High Water demonstrates that de-\nspite years of sustained international assistance, the politics of climate change in\nVietnam are used to reinforce existing political, social, and cultural structures as\nmuch as\u2014or perhaps more than\u2014to achieve the objectives needed to address it.\n\nVietnamese and international actors approach the subject of climate change\nwith divergent perspectives on its causes, impacts, and solutions, despite agree-\nment on the scientific facts that confirm its existence. Zink\u2019s fundamental argu-\nment is that scientific work is inseparable from the social, cultural, and historic\nrelationships in which it is embedded. Indeed, these observations can be applied\nbeyond the politics of climate change, as he explores more broadly \u201cwhat it\nmeans to be a scientist and to do science in Vietnam\u201d (p. vii). Zink begins by\ntracing the history of higher education in Vietnam to demonstrate the roots of\npedagogical traditions and hierarchical relationships between educators and\nstudents that continue to shape contemporary behaviors. Within this context,\nhe traces the careers of several Vietnamese climate scientists using an ethno-\ngraphic approach that reveals how climate change politics reached the agenda\nin Vietnam, as well as how externally driven policies to address global warming\nfailed to translate to a new political, cultural, and economic setting. He observes\nmultiple instances in which both Vietnamese officials and donors benefitted\nfrom the \u201cslippery spaces\u201d between policy and practice. The concept of slippery\nspaces\u2014spaces that facilitate collaborations among actors trying to achieve\ndifferent and sometimes contradictory goals\u2014is central to the observation that\nthe meaning and context of an initiative that originates in one context may be\ncompletely different when it arrives at another, such as the local level.\n\nJennifer Wallace \u2022 131\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n http://direct.m\n\nit.edu/glep/article-pdf/15/1/131/1817592/glep_r_00277.pdf by AU\nSTR\n\nALIAN\n N\n\nATIO\nN\n\nAL U\nN\n\nIVER\nSITY user on 22 July 2021\n\n\n\nThis book demonstrates effectively how historical, cultural, and economic\npractices are sticky fixtures that will not easily disintegrate as a result of knowl-\nedge transfer, technical training, or development aid. Universities, for example,\nhave their own economies, in which grant kickbacks to higher-level administra-\ntors and promotions based on kinship ties are a traditional way of conducting\nbusiness. These common local practices undermine the effectiveness of donor\ninitiatives that are intended to increase capacity-building among a new array\nof actors or to facilitate innovative research. Anecdotes in the book include a\nworkshop in which the participants were acquaintances of the organizer, who\nwas helping members of his network supplement their formal income through\nthe honoraria offered; research funds that were eaten away by informal costs or\ncorruption; and the recycling of findings or doctoring of project reports to hide\nthese realities from donors. These practices provide a damning account of the dis-\nconnect between perceived and actual project accomplishments: donors pride\nthemselves on moving money toward locally owned projects, which reinforce\nrather than challenge Vietnamese social, cultural, and economic structures.\n\nZink\u2019s book reveals a high level of familiarity with the personal connec-\ntions between scientists and their career trajectories that can only be achieved\nthrough close, sustained contact. The strength of Zink\u2019s argument is nonetheless\nbased on the anecdotal nature of his ethnographic studies, and personal expe-\nriences do not necessarily represent dominant societal trends. Zink devotes\none chapter to five personal vignettes of scientists who earned doctorates\nabroad and struggled to find work upon their return. In each case, the social\nand professional hierarchies in Vietnam failed to reward their formal training\nand expertise over customary methods of establishing status. These cases repre-\nsent a challenge toward Vietnam becoming part of the modern knowledge\neconomy. However, in an earlier chapter the author reveals how Vietnamese\nscientists used their connections with external scientific communities to achieve\nobjectives that would have been impossible in the purely local context. The\nscientists who worked to have Xuan Thuy designated as a Ramsar-protected\nsite are described as having seen \u201can opportunity to expand their environmental\ngoals with the assistance of prestige and money from abroad that could in\nturn be used to garner more allies domestically for their conservation objec-\ntives\u201d (p. 102). Juxtaposing these cases reveals that while there are societal\nobstacles in Vietnam that hinder the advancement of science or scientists based\non merit, connections with external scientific communities can still influence\npolicy and priorities locally.\n\nZink\u2019s contribution is an important critique of development models that\nnarrowly focus on the transfer of knowledge or capital between developed and\ndeveloping countries. Such models obfuscate the strategic decisions made by\nactors on both ends. In the case of climate politics in Vietnam, Zink observes\nhow slippery spaces enable both development practitioners and Vietnamese\nofficials to achieve narrowly defined objectives that end up having little direct\nimpact on the environment.

Plane Truth: Aviation\u2019s Real Impact on People and the Environment.\nLondon: Pluto Press.\n\nReviewed by Alden Griffith\nWellesley College\n\nRose Bridger\u2019s Plane Truth examines and critiques the environmental and social\nimpacts of the aviation industry. This topic is timely and relevant, given the\nindustry\u2019s recent surge in growth globally and its energy-intensive nature.\nAlthough filled with information, Plane Truth ultimately disappoints, due to a\nlack of substantive analysis and structure. This missed opportunity is unfortu-\nnate, given that the full impacts of global aviation are complex and interwoven\nwith many other factors that beg for a comprehensive and cohesive analysis.\n\nPlane Truth covers a lot of ground, including the growth and future of\naviation, energy demands and sources, local and regional impacts of airports,\nair cargo and global trade, and economic issues and policies. The book\u2019s strength\nlies in its abundance of information, which may make it a useful reference for\nsome readers. It is particularly effective at highlighting the many social and\nenvironmental injustices linked to airport construction and expansion, mainly\nthrough land seizures, local pollution, and/or altered hydrology. Examples from\naround the world reveal local impacts that are largely invisible to the travelers and\nglobal consumers who are often the main beneficiaries of these projects. How-\never, excessive information without a strong analytical framework often becomes\na drawback. This may stem from the author\u2019s approach, stated in the opening\nparagraph: \u201cWhen I began writing about aviation it was obvious that visiting\nairports would not be enlightening. So I didn\u2019t go anywhere. Instead, I used\nthe internet to research operations and expansion plans all over the world\u201d\n(p. 1). Indeed, Bridger draws heavily from Internet news sites and press releases\nto populate the book with facts, events, and statistics.\n\nSuch dense detail sometimes becomes questionable and distracting.\nFor example, Bridger discusses a single overturned jet fuel tanker truck that\nleaked its contents as evidence of the environmental effect of aviation. Yet\none could probably find the environmental equivalent of an overturned tanker\ntruck linked to almost any activity, regardless of its overall impact. While some\naviation-related fuel spills have indeed been quite large, several pages on the\nsubject fail to reveal a clear sense of the relative magnitude of the overall impact,\ngiving the impression that the author was mining for anything negative to\nreport. This issue recurs throughout the book, often leaving readers without a\nsense of scale or the relative/cumulative impacts of individual events. As another\nexample, while reporting that a takeoff by a DC-10 emits \u201cthe same amount of\n\nAlden Griffith \u2022 133\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n http://direct.m\n\nit.edu/glep/article-pdf/15/1/131/1817592/glep_r_00277.pdf by AU\nSTR\n\nALIAN\n N\n\nATIO\nN\n\nAL U\nN\n\nIVER\nSITY user on 22 July 2021\n\n\n"}
