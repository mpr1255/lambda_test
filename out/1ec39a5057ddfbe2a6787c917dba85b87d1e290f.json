Shalom (2012). The Role of U.S. Diplomacy in the Lead-Up to the Six Day\nWar. Eastbourne: Sussex Academic Press, 179 pp., $65, \u00a345.\n\nProfessor Shalom\u2019s book is another in a series of studies published over the\npast decade about the period leading up to the Six Day War. The present\nstudy focuses, according to the author, on filling the void in terms of the\ndiplomatic activity between the United States and Israel, and between the\nUnited States and Egypt. To some extent, the author successfully depicts\nthe difficult dilemmas faced by the Johnson administration before war broke\nout, and particularly from 23 May, when Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel\nNasser, declared that the Tiran Straits were closed off to Israeli navigation.\nThe Americans were unwilling to uphold their commitment to ensure free\nnavigation in the Suez Canal\u2014an obligation undertaken following the Suez\nCanal campaign of 1956. Moreover, the British, who had kept a low pro-\nfile in this conflict until the crisis began in mid-May, were willing to take\naction in order to set up a naval task force that would break the blockade;\nhowever, the Americans were not willing to partake in or lead the forces.\nThe author is indeed correct in his observation that, aside from being deep\nin the Vietnamese quagmire, the Americans feared that overly identifying\nwith Israel\u2019s plight would irrevocably ruin America\u2019s relations in the Arab\nworld.\n\nThey therefore conveyed the message to Israel that the United States\nwould not oppose Israeli action designed to ensure navigation. In other\nwords, the Americans in fact gave Israel the green light, contrary to William\nQuandt\u2019s claim that the light given was yellow.1\n\nYet the book does not, in fact, focus on the American policy involved\nin the lead-up to the Six Day War. Much of the book\u2014some 90 of the\n162 pages\u2014discusses Egyptian, Jordanian, and Israeli policies, whereas\n40 pages of the manuscript are devoted to Syria. Only in the last 60 pages\ndoes the author offer any substantial discussion about American diplomatic\nefforts. Nine chapters into it, the book seems to be less of a single, cohesive\nunit that follows the chain of events, and more of a selection of differ-\nent chapters, or chapter-parts, brought together in one publication. A prime\nexample is chapter one on Syria, which clarifies the Egyptian\u2013Syrian agree-\nment reached on 4 November, 1966, only to be later followed by chapter\n\n161\n\n\n\n162 Book Review\n\nfour that once again discusses Syria and the very same accord (see pp. 9\u201310,\n53\u201354).\n\nThe study ends somewhat strangely on 27 May, with the Israeli Foreign\nMinister\u2019s final meetings with the US administration. The book has no sum-\nmary and therefore the reason behind ending the discussion in the book\nwith the events of that day remains unclear. It is a known fact that diplo-\nmatic efforts continued with fervor beyond that point, with the arrival of Meir\nAmit, head of the Israeli Mossad, in Washington on 30 May, the British Prime\nMinister\u2019s meeting with President Johnson on 2 June, and the decision made\nby the US administration to send Vice President Hubert Humphrey to Cairo\nto meet with the Egyptian President. The meeting between Humphrey and\nNasser was made public on 3 June, and on that very day President Johnson\nsent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister, Levi Eshkol. But the failure to make\nnote of the events that followed 27 May pales in comparison with the even\ngraver error of failing to discuss the role played by the USSR at the time.\nNo research on that period in history is complete without taking a look at\nSoviet policies, which were undoubtedly key drivers in the lead-up to the\n1967 war. The author chose to speak of the Soviets\u2019 role in a handful of\nsentences dispersed throughout the book, although many studies have been\npublished on the subject and could have served as the basis for analysis of\nits impact and significance.\n\nThe book lacks footnotes on which to base the statements and argu-\nments made by the author (see pp. 9\u201312, 17\u201319, 21\u201322 and more). Quotes,\ntoo, have no appropriate footnotes. In addition, American documents serve\nas basis far too often. It is almost as if the paper is merely an archive for the\nsake of an archive. A prime example would be the mention on p. 115 of a\ndiscussion held in the Knesset, which refers readers to an American docu-\nment rather than to the Israeli Parliament records. Remarks on deliberations\namong Israeli policymakers too are not based on records found in the Israeli\nstate archives, but on British documents instead. For examples of the overuse\nof American documents please see chapter six footnotes 13\u201349 and almost\nall 65 footnotes in chapter nine. The footnote \u201cIbid\u201d is predominant, some-\ntimes appearing 11 times consecutively. Moreover, the documents used as\nbasis are merely summaries of the discussions or talks held.\n\nA few remarks:\n\n1. On p. 11: Cast Lead Operation began on 27 December 2008 and ended\non 18 January 2009, not December 2009.\n\n2. The arguments made about the Second Lebanon War (2006) and Cast\nLead Operation in the discussion on the lead-up to the Six Day War are\npresumptuous and lack historical perspective.\n\n3. The author claims on p. 5 that Israel gained confidence following the\nSuez Canal Campaign of 1956, and that the fear of conflict with its Arab\nneighbors subsided, since it had proved its military supremacy over all\n\n\n\nBook Review 163\n\nArab armed forces, and especially over Egypt. Please note that the only\nArab military force involved in the aforementioned campaign was Egypt\u2019s,\nalthough the British and French took part in it as well.\n\n4. On p. 39 the author says: \u201cwhen the question arose in 1967.\u201d What ques-\ntion? In what context? The author does not make the reference clear to\nthe reader.\n\n5. The author speaks of \u201cmany observers.\u201d Who are they? This, too, remains\nunclear.\n\n6. The author uses the term \u201cWestern Power\u201d\u2014does that include France,\nwhose policy differed from that of the UK and US?\n\n7. It is not clear why such a study should have no bibliography.\n8. The index is somewhat selective. Among others, it fails to list the following\n\nentries: Gaza, De-Gaulle, Eilat, Fowel, IDF, Lebanon, Middle East, Wheeler\nand Vietnam.\n\nIn summary, this topic is indeed fascinating, however, the author failed\nto provide the reader with the complete picture or study the processes that\nled to the war in any depth. The book is far too informative, and appears\nto be a chronology of messages the author summarizes for the reader\u2019s con-\nvenience out of American documents. As has been said before, this book\nseems to be no more than a compilation of chapters, or chapter-parts, arti-\nficially combined in a manner that lacks continuity of events, does not base\narguments through appropriate footnotes, and suffers from repetitiveness.\nOne is left with the impression that the author did not bother to use the\nliterature published before him in order to produce a better manuscript.\n\nNOTE\n\n1.
