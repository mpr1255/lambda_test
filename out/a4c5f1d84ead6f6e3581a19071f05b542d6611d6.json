With the domestic\npolitics of the issue less overriding\u2014at least for a while\u2014the major issues\ncan be reevaluated on their merits. This article considers several of the\nissues that such a revaluation should address.\n\nIn his 25 May 2011 speech before the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for President Abbas to\nstand up before his people and say, \u2018I will accept a Jewish state.\u2019\u201d The\ndemand that the Palestinian leaders must formally recognize Israel as a\nJewish state has been reiterated by Netanyahu and other members of\nhis administration since last May; while there is some ambiguity over\nwhether the demand is to be understood as an Israeli precondition before\nnegotiations for a two-state settlement can even begin, as opposed to\nbeing merely a necessary outcome of such negotiations, the weight of\nthe evidence suggests that Netanyahu and most members of his even more\nright-wing and intransigent governing coalition intend it as a precondition,\nand that is how Palestinian Authority leaders have interpreted it.\n\nJEROME SLATER is emeritus professor of political science at SUNY/Buffalo, currently\nholding the position of University Research Scholar. He is a long-time contributor to\nPolitical Science Quarterly, and is at work on a book on the United States and the\nArab-Israeli Conflict.\n\nPOLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY | Volume 127 Number 4 2012 | www.psqonline.org 597\n\n\n\nIsrael signed peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994\nwithout asking or receiving official recognition that Israel was a Jewish\nstate; and even in negotiations with the Palestinians, there was no such\ndemand included in the Oslo negotiations of 1992\u201393 or at the 2000\nCamp David and subsequent Taba negotiations in early 2001. The issue\napparently rose for the first time in 2002, when Prime Minister Ariel\nSharon declared that a peace agreement with the Palestinians must\ninclude \u201creferences to Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state and to the\nwaiver of any right of return for Palestinian refugees to the State of\nIsrael.\u201d 1 As well, in 2007, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert report-\nedly took the same position.2\n\nThe crucial point, however, is that both Sharon and Olmert were insist-\ning that the Palestinians explicitly recognize Israel as a Jewish state as a\ncomponent of an overall settlement, not as a precondition before nego-\ntiations could even begin; moreover, again unlike Netanyahu, neither\nmade the demand a central issue. For these reasons, as well as because\nof Netanyahu\u2019s obvious lack of interest in a fair peace settlement with\nthe Palestinians under any circumstances, his demand is best understood\nas a cynical ploy to raise yet another obstacle to a two-state agreement.\nNetanyahu is widely expected to be reelected in the Israeli elections sched-\nuled for January 2013 making the prospects for a two-state settlement\neven more remote. But even if an Israeli government that genuinely seeks\na two state settlement should sooner or later come to power, the Jewish\nstate demand almost certainly will continue to be an important issue.\n\nZIONISM AND THE JEWISH-STATE DEMAND\nA \u201cJewish state\u201d is generally understood to mean a state in which Jews are a\nlarge majority and have political sovereignty, whose armed forces and other\nsecurity institutions are overwhelmingly Jewish, which is predominantly\nJewish in culture and religion, and which allows, as a matter of right,\nunlimited Jewish immigration. The primary alternative conception to Israel\nas a Jewish state is that of Israel as \u201ca state of all its citizens,\u201d meaning\na fully democratic state in which all its citizens, Jewish and Arab alike,\nare fully equal, and in which Israel refrains from taking measures to\npreserve its current large Jewish majority (about 80 percent).\n\nTraditional Zionism, until recently the nearly unquestioned central\nideology of Israeli Jews, holds that Israel is and must remain a Jewish\n\n1 Quoted by Yosef Kuperwasser and Shalom Lipner, \u201cWhy the PA Must Recognize a Jewish State,\u201d\nForeign Affairs 90 (November/December 2011): 2\u20139, at 5.\n2 Raef Zreik, \u201cWhy the \u2018Jewish State\u2019 Now?\u201d Journal of Palestine Studies 40 (Spring 2011): 23\u201337, at 23.\n\n598 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nState. Today, however, a small but growing number of Israeli and Jewish\ncritics elsewhere in the West have come to regard traditional Zionism as\nan anachronism and a major obstacle to a just settlement of the Israeli\u2013\nPalestinian conflict. Though there are some differences within each school\nof thought on the issues, three general positions have emerged.\n\nAnti-Zionism\nThe most-radical critics of Zionism are probably best described as \u201canti-\nZionists,\u201d for they argue not only that Zionism should be cast aside today\nbut that because of the inherent conflict between Zionism and the rights\nof the Palestinians, the creation of a Jewish state in a land belonging\nto another people was never justified, not even in the aftermath of the\nHolocaust.3 Most anti-Zionists favor a \u201cone-state solution\u201d of the Israeli\u2013\nPalestinian conflict, meaning a binational democratic state of all its citi-\nzens (Jews, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinians in Jerusalem, the West Bank,\nand Gaza), irrespective of whether the Jews continue to constitute a\nmajority. Indeed, anti-Zionists tend to support the Palestinian \u201cright of\nreturn\u201d to Israel itself, which if realized would certainly guarantee that\nthe new binational state would have an Arab majority.\n\nPost-Zionism\nA second and more-moderate position is that of \u201cpost-Zionism,\u201d which\nholds that while Zionism and the creation of Israel was initially justified\nbecause of the Holocaust and previous periods of murderous anti-Semitism,\nit is no longer either necessary or desirable that Israel continue as a Jewish\nstate. Post-Zionists believe that Zionism has become an anachronism and\nan unbridgeable obstacle to a just settlement of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian\nconflict, and they therefore join with the anti-Zionists in supporting the\nconcept of Israel as a fully democratic state of all its citizens, with no\nspecial privileges for the Jews, and irrespective of whether the Jews con-\ntinue to constitute a large majority.4 For these reasons, post-Zionists are\nless interested in a two-state settlement of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\nthan in the creation of either a single democratic binational state or some\nkind of confederal Israeli\u2013Palestinian state.\n\n3 The best-known anti-Zionist is probably the Israeli revisionist scholar, Ilan Pappe. See especially, \u201cThe\nPost-Zionist Discourse in Israel, 1991\u20132001,\u201d Holy Land Studies 1 (September 2002): 3\u201320; and \u201cIsrael:\nBetween Civic Democracy and Jewish Zealotocracy,\u201d Journal of Palestine Studies 29 (Spring 2000):\n33\u201345. A more-recent example of vociferous anti-Zionism by an Israeli \u00e9migr\u00e9 is Gilad Atzmon, The\nWandering Who? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics (London: Zero Books, 2011).\n4 Perhaps the most well-known Israeli post-Zionist is Avraham Burg, a former Chairman of the Jewish\nAgency and the World Zionist Organization, and later the elected Speaker of the Knesset. Burg develops\nhis recent views in The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes (London: Macmillan, 2008).\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 599\n\n\n\nLiberal Zionism\nThere is no one definition of \u201cliberal Zionism.\u201d However, most Israelis\nwho identify themselves as liberal Zionists\u2014or are so considered by\nothers\u2014share a number of characteristics.5 First, liberal Zionists believe\nthat the creation of the Jewish state of Israel was justified on the grounds\nof a Jewish right and demonstrable need for a refuge from anti-Semitism.\nSecondly, however, most liberal Zionists reject traditional Zionism\u2019s other\narguments for a Jewish state in the land of Palestine on the basis of reli-\ngious claims, biblical mythology, ancient territorial \u201crights,\u201d or colonial\nimpositions (that is, the Balfour Declaration).\n\nThird, liberal Zionists are adamantly opposed to the occupation and\nto the continuously expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and\nEast Jerusalem. Rather, they favor a fair two-state peace agreement with\nthe Palestinians and generally share the international consensus of what\nsuch an agreement should comprise: the end of the Israeli occupation\nand the withdrawal of most of the Jewish settlements over the 1967 lines;\nthe creation of a Palestinian state in some 95\u201398 percent of the West\nBank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, which will become the capital of the\nstate; Palestinian or Muslim sovereignty over the Haram al-Sharif (Temple\nMount) mosque and other important Islamic sites; and limitations on\nthe size and armaments of a Palestinian army, but with international\npeacekeeping forces stationed along the state\u2019s boundaries to help guaran-\ntee the security of both Israel and Palestine against military attacks, from\nwhatever quarter.\n\nFourth, liberal Zionists certainly oppose the demand that the Palestinians\nmust formally recognize Israel as a Jewish state as a precondition for\nnegotiations, and most of them would probably not even insist that a\nfinal settlement must include such Palestinian recognition. Even so,\nthere is a certain tension, or perhaps a potential internal contradiction,\nin the liberal Zionist position. On the one hand, in principle, liberal\nZionists wish Israel to become a truly democratic state of all its citizens.\nOn the other, for political, cultural, and in some cases security reasons,\nliberal Zionists continue to wish to live in a state that remains heavily\nJewish, and support the continuation of an Israel that can serve as a\npotential refuge against a revival of severe anti-Semitism elsewhere in\nthe world\u2014which means privileging Jewish immigration into Israel and\n\n5 Well-known examples of liberal Zionists would include Uri Avnery, David Grossman, A. B. Yehoshua,\nAmos Oz, Zeev Sternhell, Chaim Gans, and the editors and most writers for Israel\u2019s elite newspaper,\nHaaretz. Prominent American Jewish liberal Zionists include Michael Walzer, Peter Beinart, and the\nJ Street organization.\n\n600 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nperhaps other measures that are designed to have or would have the\nconsequence of maintaining a large Jewish majority in Israel. Thus, the\nimplicit\u2014and sometimes explicit\u2014premise of liberal Zionism is that Israel\nwill and should remain a state in which the Jews are a large majority;\nthat is one of the most important distinctions between liberal and either\nanti- or post-Zionism.\n\nThe fullest and most-sophisticated statement of the liberal Zionist posi-\ntion is that of Chaim Gans, who argues that while many components of\ntraditional Zionism are unpersuasive, and that the Zionists undoubtedly\ncommitted crimes against the Palestinians, especially in the killing of\nthousands and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands in 1947\u201348, the\nHolocaust proved (made \u201cindisputable,\u201d in his words) the need for a\nJewish state. Moreover, Gans contends, the ongoing Israeli\u2013Palestinian\nconflict, leading to an Israeli sense of insecurity, continues to justify\nthe retention of a Jewish majority in Israel and Jewish control over\nthe army and other security institutions, although only temporarily and\n\u201ccircumstantially\u2026until a relationship of trust develops between the two\nparties\u201d and the conflict is settled.6\n\nThe unavoidable implication of the liberal Zionist position\u2014but not\nthat of the anti-Zionist or post-Zionist arguments\u2014is that its commitment\nto genuine democracy and to viewing Israel as a state of all its citizens\nwould be put to a severe test if the Jews were, for whatever reason, to lose\ntheir large majority in Israel.\n\nTraditional Zionism\nMost traditional Zionists, by far the overwhelming majority of Israelis,\nadhere to all the Zionist arguments justifying the creation of Israel in\nPalestine, as well as the standard mythology about Israeli innocence in\nthe ongoing conflict with the Arab world in general and the Palestinians\nin particular. However, there are differences over what to do about the\nIsraeli occupation, the expanding Jewish settlements, and the ongoing\nconflict with the Palestinians. Centrist-traditional Zionists tend to be\nsomewhat uneasy about the continued occupation, and support a two-\nstate settlement with the Palestinians\u2014in theory. However, when it comes\ndown to the necessary specifics, in practice even the centrists typically\noppose the Israeli concessions that are the sine qua non of a two-state\nsettlement, especially over sharing sovereignty in any part of Jerusalem\n\n6 Chaim Gans, A Just Zionism: On the Morality of the Jewish State (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n2008), 115. See also 79\u201380, 91, 100, 105, 115, 138\u2013139, 145.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 601\n\n\n\nwith the Palestinians and even a minimal return to Israel of Palestinian\nrefugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars.7\n\nRight-wing traditional Zionists, especially but by no means exclusively\nthe settlers, are opposed to ending the Israeli occupation of the West Bank;\non the contrary, they want to take over more and more of \u201cJudea and\nSamaria,\u201d including formerly Arab East Jerusalem. Therefore they oppose\na two-state settlement and any compromise with the Palestinians, for\ntheir true goal is a one-state solution\u2014not a binational one, however, but\na Greater Israel expanding over as much of biblical Palestine as feasible\nand with as few Arabs as possible, using force or other means to make life\nmiserable for the Arabs in order to induce them to move elsewhere.\n\nTHE JUSTICE OF ZIONISM: A REASSESSMENT\nThe first step in assessing the justice of Zionism is to separate the original\nargument for the necessity of a Jewish state\u2014somewhere\u2014from the argu-\nment that such a state had to be in Palestine, and nowhere else. A second\ncrucial distinction is between the argument for the creation of a Jewish\nstate in Israel after the Holocaust and the argument over whether the\ncontinuation of the Jewish state of Israel\u2014as opposed to a state of all its\ncitizens, whatever its majority\u2014is necessary, justifiable, or wise today.\n\nThe Zionist political movement\u2014Jewish nationalism\u2014emerged in\nEurope in the late nineteenth century, a reaction to the centuries-long his-\ntory of anti-Semitism in Europe and elsewhere, and especially to the revival\nof severe anti-Semitism in France and, even more so, to the murderous\npogroms in Russia and eastern Europe in the same period. And, of course,\nin the Zionist view, the Holocaust clinched the case for the creation of a\nJewish state. Indeed, by no means merely in the Zionist view, by the end\nof WWII, most Western states and their peoples agreed that the Jewish\npeople had both the right and the need for a state of their own.\n\nThat said, where a Jewish state should be located was a very different\nmatter. The terrible paradox of Zionism is that by the mid-twentieth cen-\ntury, the arguments for the creation of a Jewish state\u2014somewhere\u2014were\n\n7 The major sources for public opinion data for both Israelis and Palestinians are the regular surveys\nconducted jointly by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Center for Policy and\nSurvey Research. In their most-recent survey (December 2011), they found that while 58 percent of\nIsraelis supported the concept of a two-state settlement, only 38 percent were willing to grant the\nPalestinian government sovereignty over the Arab areas of Jerusalem, and only 42 percent supported\nthe international consensus settlement of the refugee issue, the main components of which are eco-\nnomic compensation, most refugees to be returned to Palestine rather than Israel, and only a small\nnumber allowed to \u201creturn\u201d to Israel, at Israel\u2019s sole discretion. Indeed, since the poll of Israelis included\nIsraeli Arabs, Khalil Shikaki, the head of the Palestinian Center, estimates that the figures would be\n5\u201310 percent lower for Jewish Israelis.\n\n602 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nvery strong (and in my view, prima facie), but most of the arguments for\nthe right to create that state in Palestine were very weak.\n\nThe founder of the Zionist political movement, Theodore Herzl, ini-\ntially considered the question of where the Jewish state should be located\nas an open one, a practical rather than an ideological or religious issue;\nconsequently, for some years, the Zionists canvassed a number of loca-\ntions. However, the search for alternatives to Palestine was quickly aban-\ndoned. The turning point\u2014and the origin of the Palestinian\u2013Israeli and\nthe larger Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\u2014came at the Zionist Congress of 1905,\nwhich decisively rejected any effort to create the Jewish state in any place\nbut biblical Palestine.\n\nTo be sure, even if Herzl\u2019s strictly secular attitude had prevailed, it was\nby no means certain that a Jewish state could have been created else-\nwhere; most of the supposed alternatives were frivolous and held very\nlittle promise. Perhaps the most-serious one was suggested in 1903\nwhen, following the Russian pogroms, British Colonial Secretary Joseph\nChamberlain offered 5,000 square miles of what was then British East\nAfrica to Herzl, to serve as a refuge for the Jewish people.\n\nThe Zionists were not interested. In any case, the British offer obviously\nwould not have solved the problem of a Jewish state being created by\ncolonial imposition, and ultimately, it would have simply transferred the\nproblem of the conflict between Zionism and the indigenous inhabitants\nof Palestine to those between Zionism and the indigenous inhabitants of\nUganda and Kenya, thereby probably creating an African\u2013Israeli conflict\ninstead of an Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.\n\nEven so, it is a reasonable argument that the search for a better solu-\ntion than Palestine was abandoned prematurely and, more importantly,\nfor the wrong reasons. That is, even if alternatives to Palestine ultimately\nhad proven to be unfeasible, the very willingness to search for them would\nhave required a dissociation of Zionism from biblical theology, and that\nwould have made the need for a just compromise with the Palestinians\nevident from the start.\n\nBiblical History\nFrom the nineteenth century to the present, Zionists have made a number\nof arguments for exclusive Jewish political rights in Palestine, beginning\nwith a religious one based on biblical history. However, modern biblical\nscholarship and archaeological evidence has established that most biblical\narguments, including the stories of Abraham, Moses, and God\u2019s covenant\nwith the Jews, are mere mythology. In any case, the religious Zionist claim\nthat God promised Palestine to the Jews, his Chosen People, for all eternity\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 603\n\n\n\nis one that can persuade only those people who can be persuaded by such\nan \u201cargument.\u201d Moreover, Christians and Muslims also have strong his-\ntorical connections, claims, and ties to Palestine of religion and sentiment.\nThat being the case, there is no persuasive basis for privileging the Jewish\nreligious claim.\n\nMost traditional Zionists, however, do not base their claims to Palestine\non religion, but on a secular argument based on territorial rights. Accord-\ning to biblical history, the Jews were driven out of Egypt into Palestine\u2014\nthe Exodus\u2014some time during the period 1500\u20131000 BC; they then\nconquered Palestine and established political sovereignty over it, but were\nlater driven out of Palestine by the Roman Empire after it suppressed a\nJewish rebellion in 66\u201370 AD.\n\nThere are two problems with the Zionist argument based on biblical\nhistory. The first is that today, almost no serious ancient historians or\narchaeologists believe that the evidence supports the central stories. The\nsecond and more-important problem is that even if the ancient stories were\ntrue, they would be irrelevant to establishing the justice of the modern\nZionist claim to permanent Jewish or Israeli sovereignty over Palestine.\n\nTo begin, in brief summary, there is very little historical or archaeo-\nlogical evidence to support the story of the Exodus from Egypt into Palestine,\nor that the Romans later drove most of the Jews out of Palestine. Second,\nthe evidence suggests that the Jews never established political sovereignty or\ncontrol over all or even most of ancient Palestine, or that the central home-\nland of the Jews was in Palestine: there were large Jewish communities in\nEgypt and elsewhere throughout the Mediterranean basin, and Palestine\nwas inhabited by a number of peoples, no one of which was dominant.8\n\nEven after the suppression of the Jewish uprising, most of the Jews\nremained in Palestine throughout the period of the Roman Empire, but\nover time, the majority became Christians, and later Muslims, leaving only\na small group that preserved its Jewish identity. Thus, while there con-\ntinued to be a tiny Jewish presence in Palestine for some 30 centuries,\nthe much more important fact is that only a tiny minority of the Jewish\npeople who have lived throughout the world in the last 2,000 years think\nof themselves as a \u201cDiaspora,\u201d longing to \u201creturn\u201d to Palestine.\n\nIn any case, even if the traditional Zionist stories were all true, it\nwould still remain a fallacy that they established a persuasive modern\n\n8 A summary of the scholarship and its refutation of most of the biblical mythology was published\nin \u201cThe Search for History in the Bible,\u201d Biblical Archeology Review 26 (March/April 2000). Since\nthen, the evidence against standard biblical history\u2014much of it compiled by Israeli historians and\narchaeologists\u2014has continued to mount.\n\n604 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nJewish claim to the land of Palestine. The argument that an ancient\nclaim to a land has precedence over very long periods of a different\nreality\u2014in Palestine, eight centuries of Christianity followed by thir-\nteen centuries of an overwhelming Islamic majority\u2014is accepted in\nno other place in the world, whether in law, moral reasoning, or plain\ncommon sense.\n\nPalestine has been conquered repeatedly by outside invaders since\nancient history: by Assyria, Babylon, Alexander the Great, the Roman\nEmpire, the Crusaders, the Ottoman Empire\u2014indeed, if the Old Testament\nis to be the historical source, by the Jews themselves! On each occasion,\nthe previous inhabitants of the land were killed, driven into exile, or sub-\njugated by the new rulers, who then held sway for centuries. Who, then,\nare the \u201crightful\u201d claimants? In the absence of a persuasive religious claim\naccepted by everyone (\u201cthe Promised Land\u201d), including those of different\nnationalities and religions, the stopping of the clock as it marches back-\nward in time to 20 centuries ago\u2014but neither earlier nor later\u2014must be\ncompletely arbitrary and self-serving.\n\nPut differently, by what objective criteria are the claims of one set of\nvictims\u2014the Jews, even if it had been true that they were driven out of\ntheir homeland by the Romans 2,000 years ago\u2014privileged over all other\nsuch claims? If ancient victimization is the criterion, then it is not the\nIsraelis who would have the best claim of territorial rights to Palestine,\nbut rather the descendents of the Canaanites (in some accounts, today\u2019s\nSyrians!), who the Bible tells us were driven out of Palestine by the Jews.\nOn the other hand, if recent victimization is the criterion, then all vic-\ntims of conquest after the Roman \u201cexpulsion\u201d\u2014certainly including today\u2019s\nPalestinians\u2014must have priority over the Jews.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration\nNot all the Zionist arguments for the right of the Jews to sovereignty over\nall or most or Palestine are based on biblical or ancient history. Traditional\nZionism holds that the Jews gained a modern right to establish a state in\nPalestine by virtue of the Balfour Declaration in 1917 and its subsequent\nincorporation into the League of Nations Mandate to Britain; both are\ncited in the 1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence, as modern bases\nfor the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine.\n\nThe fallacies of that argument are evident. The Balfour Declaration\ndid not call for a Jewish state, but only for a Jewish \u201cnational home\u201d\nin Palestine. Nor did the incorporation of the Balfour Declaration into\nthe League of Nations do much to increase its legitimacy, for the League\nwas basically a club of the leading colonial powers of the day who had\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 605\n\n\n\nno moral right to dispose of Palestine against the wishes of the indigenous\nmajority, then about 650,000 Arabs and only 30,000 Jews.\n\nThe Holocaust\nUnlike the other Zionist arguments, the fact of the Holocaust cannot be\ndismissed as irrelevant in legitimizing the creation of Israel. To be sure,\nthe matter is complex: the conflict between the Jews and Palestinians\nlong preceded Nazi Germany, and in any case, the Palestinians were in\nno way responsible for the Holocaust or, for that matter, for the earlier\nhistory of murderous European anti-Semitism that produced Zionism.\nAs the Palestinians ask: Why should we be made to pay for evils we did\nnot commit?\n\nOn the other hand, the Holocaust convinced most Western govern-\nments and their peoples that there was now an overwhelming and urgent\ncase for the creation of a Jewish state and a haven for the victims of anti-\nSemitism. And by the end of WWII, the die was cast: despite earlier half-\nhearted efforts to find a homeland and a state elsewhere, by 1947 there\nwas essentially no practical alternative but to create that state in a parti-\ntioned Palestine, especially as hundreds of thousands of surviving Jewish\nrefugees from Europe began arriving in Palestine and the British were pre-\nparing to end their control (the League of Nations Mandate) over the area.\n\nPerhaps it need not have been that way. In early 1945, Franklin\nRoosevelt met with King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia to discuss the\nPalestine issue. According to one account, Roosevelt was considering\nthe establishment of \u201can exclusively Jewish Palestine, with the Arabs\nbribed to leave.\u201d However, Saud was vehemently opposed, and \u201crecom-\nmended instead that the Jewish refugees of Nazi oppression be granted\nthe choicest homes and land of the defeated Germans.\u201d9\n\nOf course, nothing came of such proposals, as neither the allies nor\nthe Zionist leadership, irrevocably set on Palestine, had any interest in\nconsidering them. The result was a historical tragedy: ex-Nazi Germany\nwas probably the only country in the world in which the right of people\nnot to be expelled to make way for a Jewish state could have been readily\ndenied, both in a moral sense (in light of the Holocaust) and in practice,\ngiven the total defeat and occupation of Germany.\n\nBe that as it may, and whatever one believes about the justification for\nthe creation of a Jewish state in Palestine, since 1948 the only argument\nnecessary to the Zionist case is that Israel exists, new moral as well\n\n9 Steven L.

Indeed,\nthis \u201cexistential\u201d argument is so obvious that the prospects for an\nend to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict would be greatly enhanced if\nIsraelis could be brought to jettison their historical \u201cnarrative,\u201d for\nother than the Holocaust, it is largely mythological, would be irrelevant\neven if it were historically accurate, and is an enormous psychological\nobstacle, for both Israelis and Palestinians, to a peace settlement with\nthe Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world.\n\nSHOULD ISRAEL CONTINUE TO BE A JEWISH STATE?\nThe Jewish-state question requires consideration of two separable issues:\nshould Israel continue as a Jewish state, as opposed to a fully democratic\nbinational state of all its citizens, and should the Palestinians accept and\nformally recognize it as such, which in turn would require them to abandon\ntheir hopes for a large-scale return to Israel of Palestinian refugees who\nwere either driven out or fled from their homes and villages during and\nafter the 1948 and 1967 wars?\n\nI shall argue, first, that Israel should continue as a Jewish rather than\na binational state, but only on two conditions: it must agree to allow the\nPalestinians to have their own state, and it must finally treat its non-\nJewish citizens as full equals with the same civil rights (or almost the same,\nas I shall later argue) as its Jewish citizens\u2014and not merely in principle\nand rhetoric, which it already does, but in reality, which it has never done.\n\nSecondly, I will argue that the Palestinians should accept and formally\nrecognize Israel as a Jewish state, but not as a precondition to negotiations,\nespecially with Netanyahu or similar Israeli political leaders, who are only\ntoo likely to pocket such a Palestinian concession and find other pretexts in\norder to continue the occupation and torpedo a fair two-state settlement.\nRather, the moderate Palestinian leadership could publicly announce what\nthey have already privately conceded, that they will recognize Israel as a\nJewish state as the final component of a two-state settlement that meets\nall their legitimate demands and prerequisites\u2014principally, to have a\ngenuinely independent and viable Palestinian state.\n\nTo be sure, the argument for the continuing need and right of the\nIsraelis to consider their state as Jewish requires meeting the five major\narguments against it.\n\nA Jewish State Is No Longer Necessary\nTo begin, it is often argued that anti-Semitism has been so discredited and\nis now so weak that it is no longer necessary for the Jews to have a state\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 607\n\n\n\nof their own. This is a remarkably ahistorical argument, however, for\nit ignores the fact that there have been many other periods in Jewish\nhistory\u2014most of them far longer than the 65 years since the Holocaust\nled to a Western revulsion against anti-Semitism\u2014in which the Jews\nseemed to flourish but which culminated in revived anti-Semitic per-\nsecution, forced conversion, expulsion, or mass murder. The ancient\nexamples include\u2014but are not limited to\u2014the Roman Empire, much\nof Europe during the eleventh-century Crusades, England in the thir-\nteenth century, Spain and Portugal in the late fifteenth\u2013early sixteenth\ncenturies, and elsewhere.\n\nTo be sure, it may be argued that those ancient periods of anti-Semitism\nare no longer relevant to today\u2019s world. But what is surely relevant is the\nrevived anti-Semitism in the modern era, even before Nazi Germany: in\nFrance, Russia, and eastern Europe at the end of the nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries. In any case, the Holocaust alone was sufficient to con-\nvince most Westerners of the right and need of the Jews to have a state\nof their own. Indeed, even after the defeat of Nazi Germany, for a number\nof years, significant anti-Semitism continued in Poland and elsewhere\nin eastern Europe. Then, during the 1980s and 1990s, anti-Semitism in\nRussia, while not becoming murderous, was serious enough to convince\nhundreds of thousands of Jews that it would be wise to emigrate to Israel.\n\nIt should also be considered relevant that during the 1980s and 1990s,\nsome 80,000 Ethiopian Jews were rescued from civil war and famine,\nmany in covert Israeli military operations that brought them to the Jewish\nstate. To be sure, for the most part, they were not fleeing from anti-\nSemitism, but their need for escape and refuge\u2014and their right to\nmigrate to Israel under the Law of Return\u2014was no less urgent.\n\nNonetheless, it is the problem of anti-Semitism that continues to be\nthe primary justification for the potential need to retain Israel as a Jewish\nstate that allows unlimited Jewish immigration. American anti- or non-\nZionists typically dismiss this argument, citing the unparalleled strength\nof the American Jewish community. True enough\u2014however, the poten-\ntial vulnerability of small Jewish minorities elsewhere cannot be so\nreadily ignored. Indeed, there are disquieting indications that signifi-\ncant anti-Semitism is reappearing in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\nFor example, a recent study by an independent committee of experts\nappointed by the German parliament to study the problem of revived\nanti-Semitism found that \u201chatred of Jews is common throughout large\nswathes of German society: Far from being the exclusive province of\nthe far right or radical Islamists, it is deeply rooted in the German main-\nstream.\u201d One of the report\u2019s authors wrote: \u201cAnti-Semitism in our society\n\n608 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nis based on widespread prejudices, cliches with deep roots and pure igno-\nrance about everything to do with Jews and Judaism.\u201d Moreover, the\nreport asserted that anti-Semitism is much worse in many other European\ncountries, including Poland, Hungary, and Portugal.10\n\nWhile these developments do not portend a new Holocaust, in light of\nthe history of European anti-Semitism they cannot be ignored, especially in\nlight of today\u2019s grave economic and potentially political crises in Europe,\nconditions that historically have often resulted in a hunt for scapegoats,\nparticularly Jews. At the least, they lend credibility to the argument that\nit can never be assumed that murderous anti-Semitism is a thing of the\npast, or that a Jewish state is an anachronism.\n\n\u201cZionism Is Racism\u201d\n\nA second argument sometimes made by those calling for an end to Zionism\nis that the concept of a Jewish state assumes some kind of inherent supe-\nriority of the Jews\u2014as in the notorious UN resolution of 1975, which stated\nthat \u201cZionism is a form of racism.\u201d At the time, that resolution was widely,\nand rightly, considered to be false, if not outrageous. However, in light of\nthe recent rise in Israel of unmistakable anti-Arab and anti-black (princi-\npally Ethiopian) racism, this charge can no longer be so easily dismissed.11\n\nNonetheless, in a deeper sense, it is not accurate, for racism is not\ninherent in or an unavoidable component of Zionism and the belief that\nIsrael should continue as a Jewish state, for at its most fundamental level,\nZionism is not based on the belief that the Jews are superior to others\u2014\nrather, that they are just more vulnerable, or potentially so. That said, how-\never, if current trends continue, that argument may become increasingly\ndifficult to sustain; while it would remain the case that Zionism, per se,\nis not racist, to an alarming degree, an increasing number of Israelis are.12\n\nIsrael Is Not a Refuge\nA third argument against a Jewish state is that insofar as its purpose is\nto provide a refuge from anti-Semitism, Israel has failed to do so; the\n\n10 Odet Aderet, \u201cAnti-Semitism Is Still Flourishing Throughout Germany, Study Shows,\u201d Haaretz,\n24 January 2012.\n11 Haaretz and other Israeli publications have featured a number of news stories and commentaries on\nthe increasing racism in Israel; for example, see Neri Livneh, \u201cBelieve It Or Not,\u201d Haaretz, 27 January 2012:\n\u201cin present-day Israel, the racism has for some time been as overt as it is ugly.\u201d Note also the remarkable\npublic statement by Yuval Diskin, a recent head of the Shin Bet: \u201cOver the past 10\u201315 years, Israel has\nbecome more and more racist. All of the studies point to this.\u201d Barak Ravid, \u201cIsrael\u2019s Former Shin Bet\nChief,\u201d Haaretz, 28 April 2012.\n12 For a similar argument, see Henry Siegman, \u201cZionism Is Not Racism, But Zionists Can Be Racists,\u201d\nforeignpolicy.com, 1 May 2012.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 609\n\n\n\nleast-safe place for Jews today, it is commonly said, is the Jewish state.\nThat may be true, but the primary explanation (notwithstanding Israeli\npropaganda or genuine but mistaken beliefs) is not that Israel is a Jewish\nstate, and therefore unavoidably a target for hatred, but that it has per-\nsisted on a course that results in it being hated in the Arab/Muslim\nworld\u2014a course that cannot be justified, either morally or in terms of true\nIsraeli security. Put differently, while genuine anti-Semitism persists in\nEurope and obviously in the Arab and Muslim world, there is a strong\nargument that Israel\u2019s predicament today is largely a function not of\nits Jewishness but of its behavior; consequently, there is good reason to\nbelieve that it could safely remain a Jewish state and a potential refuge\nfor endangered Jews elsewhere, if it ended its occupation and repression\nof the Palestinians and agreed to the international consensus two-state\nsettlement that most Palestinian leaders and the Arab world as a whole\nhave agreed to accept.\n\nMost Jews Do Not Want to Live in Israel\nA fourth argument against the need for a Jewish state is that there has\nnever been a time in which most of the world\u2019s Jews have wanted to live\nin Israel. Some argue that this was the case even immediately following\nthe Holocaust, claiming that a majority of the European Jewish survivors\nwould have preferred to go to the United States rather than to Palestine.\nEven if that had been true, though, it was irrelevant, since the United\nStates was not willing to take most of them. And while there is no doubt\nthat most of the world\u2019s Jewry today has no desire to move to Israel, that\nis also irrelevant. The Jewish-state idea does not assume or require that at\nany given time most Jews want to live there; rather, it assumes that the\nhistory of the Jews being what it is, in some future circumstances a sig-\nnificant number of them may want to move to Israel, whether out of free\nchoice or desperate necessity.\n\nA Jewish State Is Inconsistent with Democracy\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it is argued that the continuation\nof Israel as a Jewish state is inconsistent with the requirements of democ-\nracy, for it prejudices the rights of the Israeli Arab minority. There is no\nescaping the fact that there is indeed an unavoidable tension between\ntwo legitimate goals: Jewish, yet democratic. Even so, as long as the Arab\nminority is not large enough to make Jewish sovereignty impossible,\nthere is no necessary or inherent obstacle that prevents equal\u2014or almost\nequal\u2014civil, political, and economic rights for Israeli Arabs. In fact,\nthe Israeli Declaration of Independence\u2014explicitly creating a Jewish\n\n610 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nstate\u2014promised to \u201censure complete equality of social and political rights\nto all its inhabitants irrespective of religion [or] race\u2026[and] guarantee\nfreedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture.\u201d\n\nOf course, that promise has been broken. In a variety of ways, Israeli\nArabs have always been treated as second-class citizens. Even the Israelis\nhave acknowledged this, and over the years, their leaders have repeatedly\ncommitted themselves to end this injustice, only to renege. Even so, the\ncommitment is significant, for in effect, it reiterates the premise of the\nDeclaration of Independence\u2014that there is no necessary contradiction\nbetween a Jewish state and full rights for non-Jews.\n\nWhat follows is that Israel has the right to remain a Jewish state if\u2014but\nonly if\u2014it finally lives up to its commitment to treat its minorities with\nfull equality. Or, at least, almost so. There are two justifiable exceptions.13\n\nSince the core purpose of a Jewish state is to provide a refuge to Jews\neverywhere, there must continue to be an unlimited right of Jewish immi-\ngration into Israel. Moreover, Gans makes a strong case that Jewish\npredominance in the armed forces and other security institutions is an\nunfortunate necessity in current circumstances, but one which \u201cdo[es]\nnot justify inequality or discrimination in all areas that are not directly\nconnected to security,\u201d including political, economic, educational, land\nallocation, and housing equality.14\n\nSurely it is true that any kind of discrimination, even if limited to\nimmigration and security policies, creates some inequality for Israeli\nArabs. Even so, pending a settlement of the Jewish\u2013Palestinian conflict,\nit is not an unbearable inequality or injustice\u2014especially if it is balanced\nby the creation of a Palestinian state with its own \u201cright of return\u201d\ngranted to Palestinians anywhere. Even genuine democracies often dis-\ncriminate in some ways in favor of some of their own people over others;\nfor example, many democracies have selective immigration policies, and\nsome go further, as in the case of France, which privileges its language,\nculture, and Western education over that of its growing Islamic and\nArab minority. Since many genuine democracies fall short in one way\nor another of perfect equality and democracy, then, the extent to which\nthere are departures from the ideal of equal rights for everyone matters a\ngreat deal.\n\n13 The argument that follows differs from that of Peter Beinart, who favors equal citizenship for all Israeli\ncitizens but does not address the issue of how that might become inconsistent with the continuation\nof Israel as a Jewish state, which he also favors. Peter Beinart, The Crisis of Zionism (New York: Henry\nHolt and Company, 2012).\n14 Gans, Just Zionism, 138\u2013139.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 611\n\n\n\nNonetheless, it must be admitted that the argument that a Jewish state\ncan be genuinely democratic, even if less than completely so, rests on the\nassumption that its Arab minority does not become a great deal larger\nthan its current 20 percent. However, that is not likely to occur, especially\nin the absence of a large-scale \u201creturn\u201d of millions of Palestinians to Israel,\nwhich, as I shall shortly argue, is an unconvincing idea that, in any case,\nhas no chance of being accepted by the Israelis. And if many years from\nnow the Arab minority in Israel somehow became much larger, it is pos-\nsible that an overall Arab\u2013Israeli peace settlement\u2014already well within\nreach, if only Israel would accept it\u2014would make the \u201cproblem\u201d much less\nimportant for Jewish Israelis. In any case, some potential or theoretical\nproblems cannot be resolved now but must be left to the future, especially\nsince they are highly unlikely to materialize.\n\nBINATIONALISM AND THE ONE-STATE SOLUTION\nThe main alternative to Israel as a Jewish state is the creation of a Jewish\u2013\nArab binational state. In the pre-state era, some leading Jewish intel-\nlectuals, including Martin Buber, Judah Magnes, and Hannah Arendt,\nargued that the state of Israel should be a democratic binational one,\nwith full equality between the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs, who would\nbe nearly equal in numbers within the projected boundaries of the new\nstate. However, this view commanded the support of very few of the pre-\nstate Jewish population, and had even less influence after the creation of\nthe state of Israel in 1948.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a considerable revival of the binational\nor confederal ideas (largely separate communities with an umbrella state\nholding limited power over them), especially among anti- and post-\nZionists, who argue that the two-state solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian\nconflict has less and less chance of ever being attained, and in any case\nwould be morally inferior to a single democratic state, in which two\npeoples, genuinely equal in every respect, live side by side in peace.\n\nWell, yes\u2014but only on the assumption that a one-state solution of the\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict would have such a utopian outcome. In prac-\ntice, a binational state would not resolve the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict,\nwould not result in democratic equality for the Palestinians, and, in any\ncase, is entirely unfeasible.\n\nWhy a Binational State Is Unfeasible\nThe Journal of Palestinian Studies, the leading scholarly journal on the\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, has published a number of articles on the\nbinational state question. It is instructive to compare the views of two\n\n612 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nof them in particular, that of Uri Avnery, a leading Israeli liberal Zionist\nwho opposes a binational state, and that of Ghada Karmi, a Palestinian\nacademician who\u2014in principle\u2014favors it.\n\nFor over 60 years, Uri Avnery has been a particularly outspoken,\narticulate, and indefatigable opponent of the Israeli occupation and\nrepression of the Palestinians. Because of his intellectual and moral\nstature, Avnery\u2019s views on the binational state issue are particularly\nworthy of note. In his 1999 article, \u201cA Binational State? God Forbid!\u201d\nAvnery argues that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians would accept\na binational state, and even if they did, the state would not be able to\nfunction and would not put an end to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.15\n\nThere is no chance that the Israelis will accept a binational state, Avnery\nargues, because \u201cit negates the very essence of the Zionist idea, the raison\nd\u2019etre of Israel as perceived by its Jewish citizens,\u201d and, clearly, by Avnery\nhimself. Moreover, that raison d\u2019etre encompasses more than the con-\ntinuing belief that a Jewish state is still necessary to serve as a refuge\nagainst severe anti-Semitism; it is also the case, Avnery argues, that most\nIsraeli Jews still want to live in a Jewish state for historical, cultural, or\nreligious reasons, and they have a right to do so.\n\nIn 2007, Ghada Karmi wrote a book arguing for a one-state bina-\ntional solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.16 However, in 2011,\nshe conceded that there were grave doubts about its feasibility and\nperhaps even its desirability\u2014and not only because of Zionist beliefs\nbut also because of Palestinian beliefs. To begin with, she acknowledged\nthat \u201cmany one-state supporters are motivated not by the principle\nof an inclusive society and equal rights, but rather by more pragmatic\nconsiderations\u2026[including] awareness of the Palestinians\u2019 ultimate\nadvantage in a one-state arrangement.17 Of course, the Israelis also have\nnoticed those consequences of binationalism: Karmi cites a 2009 poll in\nwhich only 9 percent of Jewish Israelis favored a binational state.\n\nIn any case, the problem is not only that of Israeli attitudes, for\nthere is little likelihood that a binational state would be acceptable to\nmost Palestinians, even most moderates, let alone to Hamas and its sup-\nporters, for whom it would be out of the question. Karmi notes that the\n2009 poll cited above also found that only 20 percent of the Palestinian\n\n15 Uri Avnery, \u201cA Binational State?

Switzerland and Canada are often cited as poten-\ntial models, but (even leaving aside the fact that Quebec secessionist sen-\ntiment and political movements still exist) there are very few examples\nof cases in which two peoples who have been at war with each other for\ndecades or longer have suddenly found it possible to live in peace and\nharmony within the confines of the same small state. Perhaps Northern\nIreland today\u2014although not until after some 75 years of violent commu-\nnal conflict. On the other hand, counter-examples abound: the ongoing\nHindu\u2013Muslim conflicts in India; the Greek\u2013Turkish conflict within Cyprus\nin the 1970s; the many periods of communal Muslim\u2013Christian conflict\nor outright warfare within Lebanon; the breakup of Yugoslavia and the\nensuing nationalist or religious wars of the 1990s; the still-uncertain ques-\ntion of whether Belgium can hold together, in light of renewed Flemish\nseparatist sentiment; and the unending tribal or religious intrastate con-\nflicts in Africa since the end of the colonial era.\n\nThese conflicts would seem to be much more relevant examples than\nSwitzerland of what might happen in a binational Israeli\u2013Palestinian\nstate. Given the generally unpromising history of binationalism elsewhere\nin the world, a century of bitter and often violent Jewish\u2013Palestinian\nconflict, and the huge disparities in military and economic power between\nthe Jews and the Palestinians, it is far more likely that a binational state,\nrather than ending the conflict, might even exacerbate it: even if large-\nscale communal violence or outright civil war were averted, it would\nbecome a recipe for inequality, instability, and a bitter struggle for domi-\nnance. In such a struggle, the Jews would continue to hold far greater\neconomic and military power than the Palestinians, and the end of a large\nJewish demographic majority would make it more likely that they would\nfiercely resist the loss of their domination and power than that they would\nwillingly give it up.\n\nAt best, the creation of a binational state may be an idea worth pre-\nserving, but it is not an idea whose time has come: its realization could\noccur only after many decades of real peace, mutual Israeli\u2013Palestinian\n\n18 Ibid., 72\u201373.\n\n614 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\ncooperation and goodwill, and compelling evidence that a Jewish state\nis no longer needed.\n\nSHOULD THE PALESTINIANS RECOGNIZE ISRAEL\nAS A JEWISH STATE?\nSo far, I have examined the question of whether Israel should remain\na Jewish state. A separable issue is whether the Palestinians should for-\nmally recognize it as such in the context of an overall two-state peace\nsettlement. At one level, the question has already been settled: the UN\npartition resolution explicitly divided Palestine into \u201cArab and Jewish\nstates,\u201d and from the time of its creation, Israel has been recognized by\nmost of the world\u2014implicitly or explicitly\u2014as a Jewish state.\n\nNonetheless, by demanding formal Palestinian recognition of Israel as\na Jewish state as a precondition for negotiations, Netanyahu upped the\nante, even though it is obvious that his government has neither the inten-\ntion nor the capability of reaching a two-state settlement under any con-\nditions. Whatever Netanyahu\u2019s cynicism, however, Israeli opinion surveys\nnow show that the Jewish-state demand has taken on a life of its own\namong most Jewish Israelis, reflecting their genuine and deep-seated fears\nof the ultimate intentions of the Arabs as a whole and the Palestinians in\nparticular.19 These fears may be misplaced, exaggerated, or even an unavoid-\nable consequence of Israel\u2019s occupation and repression of the Palestinians;\neven so, they have become a reality that must be reckoned with.\n\nFor that reason, there is a strong case that the Palestinians should\nagree to the Jewish-state demand as the final component of a two-state\nsettlement that met all the legitimate Palestinian demands, as they have\nbeen embodied in the international consensus proposals and plans.\nIndeed, despite their public statements that continue to reject any official\nPalestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, there have been a number\nof indications that the private position of many top leaders is different.\n\nIndeed, even Yasser Arafat\u2014or, perhaps, especially Arafat\u2014signaled\nflexibility on this issue. For example, in a very important conciliatory\nNew York Times op-ed in 2002, Arafat strongly implied that there could\nbe Palestinian recognition of a Jewish state in the context of a two-state\nagreement.20 In 2004, Arafat went further, and this time speaking directly\n\n19 The widespread popular Israeli insistence that the Palestinians must recognize Israel as a Jewish state\nis described by Yossi Alpher, a leading centrist Israeli analyst, in \u201cA Popular But Problematic Position,\u201d\nbitterlemons, 25 October 2010; and by Shlomo Avineri, a prominent Israeli political scientist, in \u201cThe\nTwo-State Solution Will Not Disappear,\u201d bitterlemons, 23 January 2012.\n20 \u201cThe Palestinian Vision of Peace,\u201d The New York Times, 3 February 2002.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 615\n\n\n\nto the Israelis. In a long interview with David Landau, the editor of\nHaaretz, and Akiva Eldar, its chief diplomatic correspondent, Arafat\nwas asked his position on the issue. In their article on the interview,\nsignificantly entitled \u201cA Jewish State? \u2018Definitely,\u2019\u201d Landau and Eldar\nwrote the following: \u201cYou understand that Israel has to keep being a\nJewish state? \u2018Definitely,\u2019 says Yasser Arafat, waving his arm for emphasis.\nHe definitely understands and accepts that Israel must be, and must stay\na Jewish state. The Palestinians \u2018accepted that openly and officially in\n1988 at our Palestine National Council,\u2019 [Arafat said] and they remain\ncompletely committed to it.\u201d21\n\nTo be sure, the position of Mahmoud Abbas (the president of the\nPalestinian Authority since 2005) on the Jewish-state issue seemingly\nhas been less flexible than Arafat\u2019s, for he continues to publicly reject\nthe Jewish-state demand, despite his unmistakable commitment to\na two-state settlement. Even so, he has clearly left himself an out: \u201cThe\n\u2018Jewish state.\u2019 What is a \u2018Jewish state?\u2019 We call it, the \u2018State of Israel.\u2019\nYou can call yourselves whatever you want\u2026. It\u2019s not my job to define\nit, to provide a definition for the state and what it contains. You can call\nyourselves the Zionist Republic, the Hebrew, the National, the Socialist\n[Republic] call it whatever you like.\u201d22\n\nOther high Palestinian officials have gone further than Abbas; for\nexample, in 2010, Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Secretary General of the\nPalestine Liberation Organizatin (PLO), bluntly stated that in the context\nof a two-state settlement, Palestine would offer \u201crecognition of Israel\nunder any formula.\u201d23 Thus, there are good reasons to believe that the\nmoderate Palestinian leadership would recognize Israel as a Jewish state\nas a final component in an overall Israeli\u2013Palestinian two-state settlement.\n\nEven so, it is necessary to address the three major arguments against\nofficial Palestinian acceptance of the Israeli demand.24\n\nThe Palestinian Narrative\nThe first is that since Netanyahu is not interested in a fair peace agree-\nment under any circumstances, the Palestinians are being asked to jettison\n\n21 \u201cA Jewish State?

In reality, however, there is no possibility of a\ntwo-state settlement\u2014even under an Israeli government that genuinely\nwanted one and was prepared to make the necessary concessions\u2014that\nmet this Palestinian demand.\n\nAside from the difficulty of imagining circumstances in which the\nIsraelis would agree to it, even on the merits the argument for a sweeping\n\u201cright\u201d of return is not convincing. In light of the long history of bitter\nand often violent Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, the influx of hundreds of\nthousands, if not millions of Palestinians\u2014estimates of the number of\nPalestinian refugees and their descendants range from three to five million\nor even more\u2014would be likely (as I argued above) to result not in the\ncreation of a stable binational democratic state but in a struggle for power\nand an intensified intercommunal conflict or even civil war.\n\nFor these reasons, most Palestinian leaders have long understood that\nthe right-of-return demand is unrealistic. In a highly important and\nauthoritative statement in 1990, Abu Iyad, the highest PLO official after\nYasser Arafat, stated the following: \u201cWe accept that a total return is\nnot possible\u2026. we recognize that Israel would not want to accept large\nnumbers of Palestinian returnees who would tip the demographic\nbalance against the Jewish population\u2026. Nonetheless, we believe it is\nessential that Israel accept the principle of the right of return or com-\npensation with the details of such a return to be left open for negotiation\u2026.\nWe shall for our part remain flexible regarding its implementation\u201d\n[emphases added].25\n\n25 Abu Iyad, \u201cLowering the Sword,\u201d Foreign Policy 78 (Spring 1990): 92\u2013112, at 103.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 617\n\n\n\nShortly afterward, Arafat himself privately signaled the real Palestinian\nposition. In June 2000, he told President Bill Clinton that \u201cwe have\nto find a happy medium between the Israelis\u2019 demographic worries\nand our own concerns.\u201d26 Similarly, in December 2000, Arafat wrote\nto Clinton that the Palestinians were \u201cprepared to think flexibly and\ncreatively about the mechanism for implanting the right of return.\u201d27\n\nThen, in his widely noted 2002 New York Times op-ed, Arafat publicly\nrepeated that there would have to be \u201ccreative solutions\u201d to the issue:\n\u201cwe understand Israel\u2019s demographic concerns and understand that the\nright of return\u2026must be implemented in a way that takes into account\nsuch concerns.\u201d28 Two years later, in his Haaretz interview, Arafat reiter-\nated that it was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d that the refugee problem would have\nto be solved in a manner that \u201cwould not change the Jewish character of\nthe state.\u201d29\n\nOther Palestinian leaders have made it clear that they are prepared to\ncompromise over the right of return, as part of a two-state settlement.\nFor example, in the Geneva Accords of 2003, negotiated by unofficial but\nhigh-level Israeli and Palestinian delegations (the latter tacitly backed\nby Arafat), the basic principles for a two-state settlement were reached.\nThe agreement was made possible by a central trade-off: the Israelis\nconceded Palestinian sovereignty over the Islamic religious sites on the\nTemple Mount/Harem el-Sharif in return for the Palestinian agreement\nthat Israel would have the sovereign right to reject any return of Palestinian\nrefugees to Israel.30\n\nMost importantly, in his 2008 negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister\nEhud Olmert, Mahmoud Abbas left no doubt that he was prepared to\neffectively drop the right of return of large numbers of Palestinian refu-\ngees. The full record of those secret negotiations has not been released,\nbut there have been a number of analyses, based on detailed interviews\nwith Abbas and Olmert, that have concluded that \u201cboth leaders agreed\non the principle that a certain number of Palestinians should return,\nbut that the governing question should be how to limit that number in\n\n26 Charles Enderlin, Shattered Dreams: The Failure of the Peace Process in the Middle East 1995\u20132002\n(New York: Other Press, 2002), 164.\n27 Jane Perlez, \u201cExpectations Low as Clinton Pushes Plan With Arafat,\u201d The New York Times, 3 January 2001.\n28 Arafat, \u201cThe Palestinian Vision.\u201d\n29 Landau and Eldar, \u201cJewish State?\u201d The first quote is Arafat\u2019s explicit words, the second is how Landau\nand Eldar paraphrased his words.\n30 The most-authoritative discussion of the Geneva Accord is provided by its chief Israeli negotiator,\nYossi Beilin, in his memoir, The Path To Geneva (New York: RDV Books, 2004). Many other knowl-\nedgeable Israeli officials have confirmed his account.\n\n618 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\na way that preserves Israel\u2019s distinction as a state with a Jewish majority\nbut that does not prejudice the rights of the Arab minority.\u201d31\n\nEven the numbers issue was essentially resolved in subsequent secret\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian negotiations. In January 2011, the British newspaper\nThe Guardian published the \u201cPalestinian Papers,\u201d based on the Wikileaks\ndocuments, which revealed that during the negotiations with Olmert in\n2009, the Palestinian leaders \u201cgave up the fight over refugees\u2026Palestinian\nnegotiators privately agreed that only 10,000 refugees and their\nfamilies\u2026could return to Israel as part of a peace settlement\u2026. PLO\nleaders also accepted Israel\u2019s demand to define itself as an explicitly\nJewish state, in sharp contrast to their public position.\u201d32\n\nThus, it has become increasingly clear that the true demand of most\nPalestinian leaders is a symbolic one\u2014that the Israelis acknowledge their\nresponsibilities for the expulsion or flight of the Palestinians during and\nfollowing the 1948 and 1967 wars\u2014but in practice, they accept that the\nrights of the Palestinian refugees can only be realized by some combina-\ntion of a small-scale family reunification in Israel, a right of return to\nthe Palestinian state of most of the refugees and their descendants, or\nvoluntary resettlement elsewhere, accompanied by major international\neconomic compensation and assistance.\n\nAside from the Palestinians, the Arab world as a whole has made\nit clear that the right-of-return issue will not be allowed to block an over-\nall Arab\u2013Israeli settlement: in 2007, the 22 states of the Arab League\nunanimously approved a peace plan that does not mention a Palestinian\nright of return but rather states that \u201ca just resolution of the refugee prob-\nlem\u201d should be \u201cagreed upon.\u201d This carefully chosen language, like the\nGeneva Accord and the Abbas\u2013Olmert negotiations, effectively grants\nIsrael a veto on the issue.\n\nThe Rights of Israeli Arabs\nThe third reason given by Palestinian leaders for refusing to formally rec-\nognize Israel as a Jewish state is that it would prejudice the rights of\nIsrael\u2019s Arab citizens, whose present de facto second-class status would\nbe effectively legitimized and made permanent. However, the Palestinians\ncould address this genuine moral issue directly, by making their conces-\nsion on the Jewish-state issue conditional upon the Israelis living up to\n\n31 The quote is from Bernard Avishai, \u201cA Plan for Peace That Still Could Be,\u201d The New York Times\nMagazine, 7 February 2011.\n32 Guardian, \u201cPalestine Papers: Palestinians agreed only 10,000 refugees could return to Israel,\u201d 24 Janu-\nary 2011.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 619\n\n\n\ntheir own principles, laws, and rhetoric and truly giving the Israeli Arabs\nfull civil, political, economic, and educational rights.\n\nIn the context of the end of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, it should\nnot be difficult for Israel to agree to this condition, for (as I have pointed\nout) in theory, it has already done so\u2014in its Declaration of Independence,\nin many of its laws, and in the repeated promises of its leaders. Of course,\nIsrael has violated these commitments throughout its history, so what\nwould prevent it from continuing to do so? In practice, perhaps not\nmuch, given the disparity in power between the Jews and the Arabs, as\nwell as the Israeli willingness to disregard international opinion. But\nthat is not the point. Since Israel cannot be forced to live up to its prin-\nciples and, for that matter, to its own laws and international commit-\nments, surely the best chance that it will do so in the future would be\nin the context of peace with the Palestinians as well as the Arab world\nas a whole.\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF HAMAS\nThere is increasingly strong evidence that Hamas is gradually moving\ntoward a pragmatic if reluctant acceptance of the realities of power, and\ntherefore has become increasingly amenable to a de facto if not de jure\ntwo-state political settlement with Israel. If the current trend continues,\nthe evolution of Hamas will parallel that of Arafat\u2019s PLO, as well as many\nother radical movements that became much more moderate when they\nhad countries to run. To be sure, this movement has been in fits and\nstarts, and it is not without ambiguity. Nonetheless, the direction of the\nmovement is clear.\n\nIt is now known that soon after the Gazan parliamentary elections of\n2006, won by Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, the new Gazan prime minister,\nsent a secret written message to George W. Bush, offering a truce for many\nyears in exchange for a compromise political settlement; neither Bush nor\nthe Israeli government responded to this and additional overtures.33\n\nSoon after that, Hamas began to go public with its new position. For\nexample, in May 2006, Haniyeh told Haaretz that the Hamas government\nwould agree to a long-term truce with Israel if it withdrew to the 1967 lines.\nIn the same year, Khaled Meshal, widely considered the most-powerful and\npreviously one of the most-militant of the Hamas leaders, said that Hamas\ncould not oppose the unified Arab stance expressed in an Arab League\nsummit conference, which offered Israel full recognition and normalized\n\n33 Barak Ravid, \u201cIn 2006 Letter to Bush, Haniyeh Offered Compromise With Israel,\u201d Haaretz, 10 Novem-\nber 2008.\n\n620 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nrelations in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\nterritories and a solution to the refugee problem.34\n\nOf particular importance was a May 2006 joint statement of senior\nHamas and Fatah members who were imprisoned in Israel, for the pres-\ntigious \u201cPrisoner\u2019s Declaration\u201d went much further than the earlier Hamas\novertures: abandoning the previous ambiguities, it called for the establish-\nment of a Palestinian state \u201cin all the lands occupied in 1967,\u201d and\nreserved the use of armed resistance only in those territories.35\n\nOnce in power over Gaza, Hamas\u2019s political position continued to\nevolve\u2014and important Israelis began to take notice and to call for a\nchange in Israel\u2019s policy of refusing to deal with Hamas. For example,\nin late 2006, Yossi Alpher, a former deputy head of the Mossad and a pillar\nof the centrist Israeli establishment, wrote: \u201cHamas\u2019 conditions for a long-\nterm hudna or ceasefire\u2026are almost too good to be true. Refugees and\nright of return and Jerusalem can wait for some other process; Hamas\nwill suffice with the 1967 borders, more or less, and in return will guaran-\ntee peace and quiet for ten, 25 or 30 years of good neighborly relations\nand confidence-building.\u201d36\n\nShortly before the Israeli attack on Gaza in December 2008, Ephraim\nHalevy, a former head of Mossad and the national security adviser in Ariel\nSharon\u2019s 2002\u201303 government, argued that Hamas had \u201crecognized\u2026\n[that their] ideological goal [was] not attainable,\u201d and consequently that\n\u201cthey [were] ready and willing to see the establishment of a Palestinian\nstate in the temporary borders of 1967.\u201d To be sure, Halevy acknowledged,\nHamas leaders were still talking in terms of a \u201ctruce\u201d rather than a perma-\nnent settlement; however, he continued, \u201cthey know that the moment a\nPalestinian state is established with their cooperation, they will be obligated\nto change the rules of the game: they will have to adopt a path that could\nlead them far from their original ideological goals.\u201d37\n\nSince the end of the Israeli attack on Gaza in January 2009, Hamas\u2019s\nposition has continued to evolve. In March 2010, Halevy again argued\nthat Israel must reconsider its policies toward Hamas: \u201cHamas has dem-\nonstrated a serious capacity to exercise responsibility and restraint\nwhen that role suits its purpose. Why not hammer out a temporary\n\n34 Danny Rubinstein, \u201cDon\u2019t Boycott the Palestinians,\u201d Haaretz, 13 February 2006.\n35 Arnon Regular, \u201cHamas, Fatah Prisoners Agree to Two-State Solution in Joint Draft,\u201d Haaretz,\n11 May 2006 (emphases added).\n36 Alpher was the co-editor of the Israeli online publication, bitterlemons; the quote is from his article,\n\u201cProblematic Options,\u201d 20 November 2006.\n37 For a discussion of Halevy\u2019s comments, see Henry Siegman, \u201cIsrael\u2019s Lies,\u201d London Review of Books\n31 (January 2009): 3\u20135.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 621\n\n\n\narrangement\u2026that would, say, extend for 25 years with a clause for\nrenewal\u2026. Current policy, after all, sends Hamas the signal that it is\ndoomed to exclusion\u2026. But the more that Hamas is permitted inside\nthe tent, the better the prospects of a modest (yet historic) success.\u201d38\n\nIn September 2010, Hamas revealed that for some time, it had been\ntelling the United States that it would end its resistance activities once\nIsrael ended its occupation and accepted a Palestinian state within the\npre-June 1967 borders.39 Finally, in December 2011, Khalid Meshal\nstated that Hamas was switching from armed struggle to mass popular\nprotest and unarmed civil disobedience; a few days later, Haaretz reported\nthat Hamas was joining with the Palestinian Authority to seek negotia-\ntions with Israel for a two-state settlement based on the 1967 borders\nand that Meshal had issued orders to Hamas\u2019s military wing to end all\narmed attacks on Israel. In fact, terrorist attacks on civilians had already\nbeen suspended by Hamas for several years (although some Islamic Jihad\nattacks had continued), but Hamas\u2019s new policy also prohibited attacks\nagainst Israeli military forces in the occupied territories.40\n\nA number of factors have accounted for the ongoing evolution of\nHamas thinking, including the realities of governing, especially when\nmost Gazans continue to favor an end to the conflict and a two-state\nsolution; the fact that most Arab governments\u2014particularly the most-\nimportant ones, Egypt (there are many indications that post-Mubarak\nEgypt will continue to observe its cold peace with Israel41), Saudi Arabia,\nJordan, and probably Syria (regardless of the outcome of the revolution\nagainst the Assad government)\u2014support a compromise settlement solu-\ntion and fear Islamic fundamentalism; the economic sanctions imposed\nby Israel, the United States, and a number of European states after the\n2007 Hamas takeover of Gaza; and, undoubtedly, the ongoing Israeli\neconomic pressures, assassinations, and military attacks.\n\n38 Ephraim Halevy, \u201cWhy Not Hamas?\u201d New Republic, 26 March 2010.\n39 \u201cHamas: We Told U.S. in the Past That We Would Accept a Palestinian State Along 1967 Borders,\u201d\nHaaretz, 20 September 2010; Zvi Bar\u2019el, a leading Haaretz political analyst, noted the significance of\nthe Hamas evolution: \u201cNot a return of refugees, not the destruction of the State of Israel, no precondi-\ntions.\u201d (Zvi Bar\u2019el, \u201cIs Hamas Really Willing to Change?\u201d Haaretz, 7 December 2010.\n40 The previous paragraph is based largely on Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, \u201cHamas Forces Ordered\nto Cease Attacks on Israeli Targets, Palestinian Sources Say,\u201d Haaretz, 29 December 2011; see also the\nHaaretz op-eds by Zvi Bar\u2019el, \u201cIsrael Shouldn\u2019t Ignore Palestinian Reconciliation Deal,\u201d 28 December 2011,\nand Merav Michaeli, \u201cIsrael Is Missing Another Opportunity For Peace,\u201d 2 January 2012; Fares\nAkram, \u201cHamas Says That Its Political Leader Does Not Plan to Seek Re-election,\u201d The New York\nTimes, 21 January 2012.\n41 The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has been pressing Hamas to end armed struggle against Israel and\nto join with Fatah in seeking a two-state settlement. Cf. David D. Kirkpatrick, \u201cIslamic Victors in Egypt\nSeeking Shift by Hamas,\u201d The New York Times, 24 March 2012.\n\n622 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nSo far, the Israeli government has ignored all the Hamas overtures.\nTo be sure, Meshal has said he still reserves the right of Hamas to resume\narmed struggle in the future, has not renounced the Palestinian right\nof return, and has not offered to officially recognize Israel, as a Jewish\nstate or not. Nonetheless, if a two-state settlement were to be reached,\nit would result in an end to the Israeli occupation and repression of the\nPalestinians; it would probably (under most proposed settlements) be\nenforced by international peacekeeping troops, almost certainly including\neither U.S. or NATO forces; it would be endorsed by nearly the entire\nworld, including almost every Arab state; and it would almost surely\nbe accompanied by massive international economic assistance to the\nnew Palestinian state. Under such circumstances, even if Hamas (or more\nradical groups) wanted to resume attacks, it is hard to imagine that it\ncould gain the support of the Palestinian population, let alone of the Arab\nworld, for a pointless, bloody, and dangerous war, a war that would have\nno chance of defeating Israel, could destabilize the entire region, and\nwould surely result in an even more-draconian Israeli reoccupation of a\ndefunct Palestinian state.\n\nThe Mouse that Roared: If the Mouse proclaims that one day it will\ndefeat the Lion and replace it as King of the Jungle, does the Lion worry?\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of Israel\u2019s ongoing expansion into the occupied Palestinian terri-\ntories, the prospects for a two-state settlement are steadily being under-\nmined. Nonetheless, since a one-state binational solution is not in the\ncards\u2014every obstacle to the attainment of a two-state settlement makes\na one-state settlement inconceivable\u2014a two-state solution remains the\nonly hope for the future, however bleak the prospects currently appear\nto be. History is full of surprises, and\u2014faut d\u2019mieux\u2014that hope must\nremain the only alternative to simply surrendering the battle for peace\nand justice.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis insist that their state\nmust remain a Jewish one, not only because of the possible need for Israel\nas refuge, but also for historical, religious, and cultural reasons. For these\nreasons, there does not appear to be any compelling reason to deny them\nthis demand\u2014but only so long as they grant near-full equality to Israeli\nArabs and do not prevent the Palestinians from having comparable rights\nin their own genuinely independent and viable state.\n\nSince most Palestinian leaders have privately accepted these realities,\npublicly stating that in the context of a two-state settlement they would\naccept the Israeli position on the Jewish-state issue would accomplish a\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 623\n\n\n\nnumber of things. At a minimum, it would expose the fact that the present\nIsraeli government has no intention\u2014under any circumstances\u2014of ending\nthe occupation and allowing the creation of a viable Palestinian state.\nConsequently, it would increase international pressures on Israel and, in\nparticular, might finally lead to a reassessment of the near-unconditional\nU.S. support of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. And perhaps most\nimportantly, it would reassure those Israelis who genuinely fear for the\nfuture of Israel as a Jewish state, thus paving the way to a possible future\nsettlement under a different Israeli government.\n\nTo be sure, because the realities of the Jewish-state/right-of-return\nissues have never been explained to the Palestinian people, it would be\nan act of considerable courage for their leaders to publicly reveal their\ntrue bottom line. On the other hand, if in the future an Israeli government\noffered a genuine two-state compromise plan based on international con-\nsensus, Palestinian leaders could call for a referendum, strongly recommend\napproval, and make an essentially irrefutable case that the Palestinians\nwould be far better off if they gave up the right of return and recognized\nIsrael as a Jewish state, in return for which the Israeli occupation would end,\nand Palestine would become an independent state with East Jerusalem\nas its capital, would have Islamic or international control over all Islamic\nreligious sites, would have control over the water resources of the West\nBank, and would receive massive international economic assistance.\n\nMoreover, in recommending approval, the leaders could forcefully point\nout the likely consequences if the Palestinian public rejected a two-state\nsolution constructed along such lines: international pressures on Israel\nwould almost surely end, the deal might never be offered again, and the\nPalestinians would be condemned to an indefinite continuation of the\noccupation and Israeli expansion into its territory, along with repeated\nmilitary attacks and economic punishments. In this context, there would\nbe good reasons to believe that the Palestinians would not reject a com-\npromise peace settlement, even though it would fall well short of their\nhopes and dreams, including their legitimate ones.\n\nEpilogue\nAs was surely inevitable, the poison of some 45 years of the Israeli occu-\npation, violence, and repression of the Palestinians has steadily seeped\ninto the Jewish state itself, making the standard clich\u00e9\u2014\u201cIsrael is the only\ndemocracy in the Middle East\u201d\u2014steadily more dubious. Israel today is\nbecoming increasingly authoritarian, theocratic, racist, and intolerant of\ndissent, including Jewish dissent, which has become increasingly subject\nto political and even police repression. If these trends continue\u2014in fact\n\n624 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY\n\n\n\nthey are accelerating\u2014Israeli \u201cdemocracy\u201d will be best described as a\ndemocracy for Jewish Israelis who support the government\u2019s policies\non the Palestinian issue.\n\nFor these reasons, it must be acknowledged that it has become increas-\ningly difficult to separate the issue of whether Israel should continue as a\nJewish state from the kind of Jewish state it has become. Even so, the\npremise of this article has been that it may still be possible to separate\nthese issues, that the current trends in Israel may yet be checked, and\nthat there is still a chance that Israel can return to its senses, both in terms\nof its treatment of the Palestinians and in its domestic government and\nsociety. If not, however, liberal Zionists, like this writer, may be forced\nto conclude that while in principle the Jewish people have a right of a\nstate of their own, the case for even liberal Zionism is collapsing and Israel\nis becoming a failed state, certainly in a moral sense and probably, in the\nlong run, as a truly safe haven.\n\nISRAELI\u2013PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT | 625\n\n\n"}
