While the vast majority of the literature on\ncivil wars in Africa concentrates on drivers of conflict and instances\nof violence, there are zones of peace where locally peace pro-\ncesses have developed despite conflicts around them. These\nspaces have been neglected in both the academic literature and\nthe major data sets on conflict and war, which mostly focuses on\nthe belligerent, or sometimes the victims. The literature that does\nexist is concentrated in Latin America (especially Colombia) rather\nthan Africa. This paper records six different episodes in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone and seeks to understand the reasons\nwhy these spaces were able to maintain some level of peace.\nThe paper discusses the practicalities of exercising peace on the\nground and the implications for subsequent peacebuilding, along\nwith drawing conclusions about differences in the nature of war-\nfare regionally.\n\nARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 15 December 2017\nAccepted 30 May 2018\n\nKEYWORDS\nPeace; conflict resolution;\nrestraint; conflict; civil\nsociety; C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire; Sierra\nLeone; West Africa\n\nIntroduction\n\nResearch on conflict resolution has mainly focused on war prevention or post-conflict\nreconciliation. Nevertheless, there has been an increase in literature on so-called zones\nof peace: territories in which communities aim to reduce the negative impact of armed\nconflict through non-violent means.1 However, this logic of non-violence during con-\nflict is scarcely covered in the African academic literature, and yet across two very\ndifferent conflicts in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone, we can observe the same phenom-\nenon of localised grassroots peace initiatives and activities during conflict. Local com-\nmunities are not passive within wars and make choices between violence and peace\ndepending on their own perceptions of risks and returns. However, contemporary data\nsets document significant instances of violence against civilians (the Truth and\nReconciliation Commission in Sierra Leone documents more than 40,000) but none\ndocument instances of peace. Our knowledge on how civilians manage to contain\nviolence or contribute to non-violence in conflict-affected environments is very limited.\n\nCONTACT Paul Jackson p.b.jackson@bham.ac.uk\n1Hancock, L. and Mitchell, C.

Communities\nwithin these zones engage in civil resistance to armed actors by applying unarmed\npower and non-violent methods including strikes, boycotts and demonstrations, or just\nnon-compliance.6 This article takes six examples where local agreements have resulted\nin localised peace across Sierra Leone and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and then examines how far they\nconform to the logic of zones of peace literature.\n\nThis paper makes two important contributions to the literature on peacebuilding in\ngeneral, and peace zones specifically. First, it is also important to note that despite the\nproximity and similarity between the various West African wars, there has not been\nmuch comparative work between them.7 The causes of the war for both Sierra Leone\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire have been very much debated, and there is a large volume of evidence\non the wars.8 Despite this, the only comparative article is Chauveau and Richards\nfocussing on agrarian change, showing how violence offers scope for adjustment to\npressure when other means fail.9 Their comparison contrasts different trajectories of\nagrarian social change, making the point that C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire was a conflict to uphold a\nlineage-based social order, while this was the opposite for Sierra Leone.\n\nSecond, the literature on zones of peace is primarily concerned with Latin America,\nparticularly Colombia, with other examples drawn from the Philippines. Whilst there is\nsome short discussion on examples as wide ranging as Northern Ireland, South Africa\n\n2Garc\u00eda Dur\u00e1n, M., Movimiento por La Paz en Colombia 1978\u20132003 (Bogota: CINEP, 2006); Kaplan, O. \u2018Nudging Armed\nGroups: How Civilians Transmit Norms of Protection\u2019, Stability, 2, no.2 (2013): 1\u20138; Annette Idler, Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n Garrido\n& C\u00e9cile Mouly., \u2018Peace Territories In Colombia: Comparing Civil Resistance In Two War-Torn Communities\u2019, Journal of\nPeacebuilding & Development, 10, no.3 (2015): 1\u201315; Garcia, E., \u2018Filipino Zones of Peace\u2019, in Peace Review 9, no.2 (1997):\n221\u2013224; Arviola, Jr, S. \u2018Community-Based Peace Building Program: The Case of Bual Zone of Peace, Philippines\u2019, in\nAsia-Pacific Social Science Review 8, no.2 (2008): 51\u201359.\n\n3Krause, J., \u2018Non-violence and civilian agency in communal war: Evidence from Jos, Nigeria\u2019, African Affairs, 116, no.463\n(2017): 261\u2013283.\n\n4Krause, \u2018Non-violence and civilian agency\u2019.\n5Hancock and Mitchell, Zones of peace.\n6Idler et al, \u2018Peace territories in Colombia\u2019.\n7Hoffman, D., The War Machines: Young Men and Violence in Sierra Leone and Liberia (Durham, North Carolina: Duke\nUniversity Press, 2011); Allouche, J., Benson M. and M\u2019Cormack, F., \u2018The End of the Mano River War(s)\u2019, IDS Evidence\nReport. 188 (2016).\n\n8Banegas, R., \u2018Briefing: Post-Election Crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire: The Gbonhi War\u2019, African Affairs 110, no.440 (2011): 457\u201368;\nMcGovern, M.

ALLOUCHE AND P. JACKSON\n\n\n\nand the Caucasus, the literature in these areas is sparse. For Africa, a continent blighted\nby conflict, there is surprisingly little literature on zones of peace and almost none on\nthe Mano River Region. This article therefore makes an important contribution to the\noverall literature by adding new examples in an under-researched field and in a new\ngeographical area not currently addressed by the literature.\n\nThis paper uses an inductive approach to draw out lessons that can be used to\nexplain localised peace processes, or \u2018zones of peace\u2019. It takes a retrospective view of two\nconflicts known to the authors and documents six specific cases of localised peace\nprocesses within conflicts. The primary data for our analysis are based on interviews for\nboth of our case studies, most notably with former combatants, Young Patriots mem-\nbers, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Community Defence Forces (CDF), civil\nservants and local government officials, traditional leaders and representatives of the\nreligious community, and citizens. The authors have long histories of working in these\ncountries, including fieldwork in Sierra Leone between 2002 and 2005 on decentralisa-\ntion and Chiefdom systems, 2007, 2009 and 2013 on security sector reforms, and in\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire between 2011 and 2013 on the civil war and 2014 and 2017 on large-scale\ninvestments and peacebuilding.\n\nThis article starts by examining the current literature on this subject and focuses and\ndevelops this idea of zones of peace. It will analyse three examples in both C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nand Sierra Leone, defining these communities and their relationship with armed groups,\nand understanding the extent to which this peace process is externally influenced or\ninternally driven. It will particularly focus on the creation of these peace zones, rather\nthan the implementation of peace. Through these micro-case studies, the authors will\nquestion the current literature emphasis on peace and armed forces and the particu-\nlarity of the West African setting in terms of leadership and agency.\n\nWhat governs zones of peace?\n\nIn seeking to understand the logic of violence, Kalyvas uses the example of two very\nsimilar and contiguous Greek villages in the peninsula of the Peloponnese that faced\ntwo different trajectories: one resulted in a general massacre while the other prevented\nthis type of violence.10 He concludes that territorial contestation is a key variable to\nexplain both the prevalence of violence and its absence but importantly also concludes\nthat the outcomes are linked to different alliances within networks that link the local\nand national. This opens up the potential of analysing the dynamics that lead to peace\nrather than conflict and what Strauss calls the dynamics of restraint. Strauss defines\nfactors of restraint as ideas, interactions and institutions that provide incentives for\nleaders and/or citizens to abstain from, or moderate, extensive violence in the way that,\nfor example, Williams documents in India.11 Williams\u2019 emphasis on \u2018understanding the\npersistence of everyday harmony\u2019 shifts the emphasis from understanding the dynamics\nof conflict to understanding and researching the dynamics of peace.12\n\n10Kalyvas, The Logic of Violence.\n11Williams, P., \u2018Hindu-Muslim brotherhood: exploring the dynamics of communal relations in Varanasi, North India\u2019,\nJournal of South Asian Development 2, no.2 (2007): 153\u2013176; Straus, S., \u2018Retreating from the Brink: Theorizing Mass\nViolence and the Dynamics of Restraint\u2019, Perspectives on Politics 10, no.343\u201362 (2012): 344.\n\n12Williams, \u2018Hindu-Muslim\u2019, 154.\n\nPEACEBUILDING 73\n\n\n\nHancock and Mitchell draw on empirical evidence primarily from Colombia but also\nfrom the Philippines, in establishing eight factors for successful peace zones, and make\nit more likely that a community will convince armed actors to comply with rules that\nallow a reduction of violence13: (1) strong internal cohesion and leadership and efforts\nto expand the functions of the sanctuary beyond protection; (2) declared neutrality and\nimpartial behaviour of the people residing in the territory, (3) presence of credible\nsanctions for violation, (4) absence of perceivable threats to outside interests, (5) a\nframework of accepted rules and norms regarding rights and obligations of both the\ncommunity and external actors, (6) limited incentives for community members and\narmed actors to violate this framework, (7) strong patron interest in the preservation of\nsanctuary and leverage on potential violators and (8) clear markers on the territorial\nboundaries of the zone. Idler et al. further simplify these eight factors in to three groups\n\u2018for the purpose of analytical clarity\u2019 and it is these three groups that we will use to\nframe our analysis14: the characteristics of the civil resistance movement in the peace\nterritory, (1); the relationship of the community with armed actors, (2)\u2013(6); and the role\nof external actors, (7) and (8).\n\nThe characteristics of the civil resistance movement\n\nKaplan identifies social cohesion as a critical element of civil society movements that\nseek to engage with armed actors.15 Social cohesion allows institutional solutions to\navoid participation in conflict, manage internal community in order to limit the ability\nof armed groups to infiltrate local communities and also to demand accountability from\nthose groups. This is similar to Varshney and Krause\u2019s analysis of ethnic conflict in\nIndia and Nigeria, respectively, further that takes social cohesion and civilians as key\nagents within these networks, again emphasising processes over variables.16 Widespread\nparticipation of community members in local peacebuilding activities helps to enforce\nand encourage social cohesion but also the resulting collective action serves to enhance\ndomestic protection within that community and strengthen the hand of any community\nnegotiating with an armed actor.17 The literature further develops this by stressing the\nimportance of collective leadership, specifically leadership that does not rely on one\nindividual, but where the entire community participates, or at least supports\nthe initiative.18\n\nIn Africa, the idea of including different actors is very much present in peacebuilding\ndebates but has been associated with the inclusion of civil society voices into the\npolitical settlement.19 Several studies show the strong correlation between civil society\n\n13Hancock and Mitchell, Zones of Peace.\n14Idler et al, \u2018Peace territories in Colombia\u2019, p.2.\n15Kaplan, O., \u2018Protecting Civilians in Civil War: The Institution of the ATCC in Colombia\u2019 in Journal of Peace Research 50,\nno.3 (2013): 351\u2013367.\n\n16Varshney, A, Civic life and ethnic conflict: Hindus and Muslims in India (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002); Krause,\n\u2018Non-Violence and Civilian Agency\u2019.\n\n17Arjona, A, \u2018Civilian Resistance to Rebel Governance\u2019, HiCN Working Paper 170, Households in Conflict Network, Institute of\nDevelopment Studies (Brighton: University of Sussex, 2014); Kaplan, \u2018Protecting Civilians\u2019.\n\n18See Hancock and Mitchell, Zones of Peace (p. 212), for a detailed discussion on this.\n19Tadros, M and J. Allouche, \u2018Political settlements as a violent process: deconstructing the relationship between political\nsettlements and intrinsic, instrumental and resultant forms of violence\u2019, Conflict, Security and Development 17, no.3\n(2017): 187\u2013204.\n\n74 J. ALLOUCHE AND P. JACKSON\n\n\n\nparticipation and sustained peace and, whilst democracy has been seen as the main\nexpression of inclusion, this ignores local social and political dynamics and the actual\nconstruction of legitimacy at the local level.20 In addition, the incorporation of civilian\nagency is a critical aspect of this, particularly as supporters or as opposition to violent\ngroups. In Sierra Leone, for example, local populations established kamajor militias as\nCDF to fight the RUF, drawing from a variety of local institutions including secret\nsocieties, hunter militias and village groups. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, local militias were also\ncreated to fight against mostly Liberian mercenaries that were causing instability in the\nWestern region following the armed conflict in 2002. The local community is therefore,\nin many ways, an extremely pluralistic one with multiple groups that have been difficult\nto form into a coherent voice. Research on West Africa in particular, though not\nexclusively, emphasises the role of dense networks of institutions at the local level\nthat provide the sinews of sociopolitical networks.21 These networks comprise a multi-\ntude of overlapping institutions, both formal and informal, seen and unseen, under-\npinned by what James Scott refers to as \u2018infrapolitics\u2019.22\n\nThis is further complicated by the issue of collective leadership in a context where\nleadership has been dominated by the idea of what Utas calls \u2018Bigmanity\u2019.23 Bigmanity\nexists within frameworks of warfare in parts of Africa that exhibit some of the key\ncharacteristics of Duffield\u2019s networked warfare whereby wars do not follow the tradi-\ntional state-based patterns of warfare but multiple actors each pursuing different aims.24\n\nCritically, wartime networks in West Africa consisted of a multitude of actors incor-\nporating politicians, military, financial, trading, international, smugglers, international\nNGOs, religious leaders, warlords and local leaders like chiefs. Each of these networks\nalso exists at different levels of society from the international to the village. This\nconceptualisation of conflict undermines traditional ways of looking at conflict as\ndefined by clear categories including religion or ethnicity, but more particularly there\nare very few clear boundaries between groups, whether peaceful or not. However, it\ndoes allow for the positive use of Bigmanity to change the shape of social networks for\npeace as well as conflict if the incentives are right.\n\nThe community and armed actors\n\nThe second major group is the relationship of the community with the armed actors.\nCertainly in long-established movements like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of\nColombia, it is very likely that there will be very close relationships between the\n\n20John, A.

These armed groups are therefore both a\nthreat and also embedded within local communities. Whilst it may be the case that this\ncould make it easier to negotiate with armed groups, it does not seem to be clear cut\nwithin the literature. Links may act as conduits through which negotiation may happen,\nbut that does not mean that peace zones are necessarily the clear outcome of those\nnegotiations, suggesting that the linkages between communities and armed groups are\nmore complex than first conceptualised, particularly in terms of defining boundaries.\n\nThis may lead to trust difficulties. Negotiation requires direct and trusted channels\nbased on relationships, which may exist between family and are common in other\nconflicts, but trust can be extremely sensitive to context. Without interpersonal trust\nwithin the community, for example, direct negotiating channels and relationships\nbetween groups can be exploited for personal gain, sometimes against other members\nof the community, or used as a form of power, particularly when access to information\nis exploited by gatekeepers.25 Mistrust within the local community attacks the very core\nof a peace zone, which relies on cohesion to act collectively against the violent actor,\nand community members may begin to follow guerrilla set rules rather than commu-\nnity ones. In Colombia, Idler et al. found that as long as everyone follows the rules, the\nguerrillas respect the community.26 This may be significantly complicated by the\npresence of multiple violent groups; however, each of which may or may not have\ntheir own rules. As Hancock and Mitchell point out, one of the most difficult environ-\nments for peace zones is where the control of a previous actor is disrupted by a rival\nattempting to take control of a territory.\n\nA critical element of the overall relationship, however, is the role of incentives to\nmaintain or undermine the peace itself. As Hancock and Mitchell identify, there has to\nbe limited incentives to violate the framework and this can be extremely difficult to\nestablish. This speaks directly to the underlying causes of conflict itself and the aims of\nthe different actors within peace processes. What motivates each party and what was the\norigin of the conflict in the first place are usually influential in the nature of the\nresulting peace. What much of the literature around zones of peace tends to emphasise\nis the positive peace: zones are about bottom-up, community based and negotiated\npeace, whereas the underlying causes of the conflict may lead to different outcomes\nbased on those underlying drivers. This may, of course, lead to positive peace outcomes\nof democratic and community-based peace as an expression of the importance of voice,\nor it could lead to what effectively amounts to short-term business transactions if\neconomics is the underlying driver.\n\nThe role of external actors\n\nThere are also tensions between local communities and external actors. Certainly, there\nare significant external actors involved in most conflict areas, particularly NGOs. Much\nof the scholarship on zones of peace so far has examined grassroots initiatives that were\npartly established and driven by communities but with significant external support. For\n\n25Kaplan, \u2018Protecting Civilians\u2019 also points out that information can be distorted in some of these relationships.\n26Idler et al, \u2018Peace Territories\u2019.\n\n76 J. ALLOUCHE AND P. JACKSON\n\n\n\nexample, Idler et al. discuss the role of REDEPAZ in Colombia as an external actor that\nadvised local leaders to establish a peace zone as part of a bigger \u2018One Hundred\nMunicipalities of Peace in Colombia\u2019 project.27 At the same time, much of the literature\non zones of peace is concerned with how to establish them and what is required for one\nto work and contains several discussions of the role of NGOs in supporting the\ndeliberate establishment of zones of peace.28\n\nIn general, the literature on the role of external actors tends to mirror broader\nliterature on the tensions between bottom-up and top-down approaches to activity.29\n\nExternal support mechanisms for expertise, finance, legal and strategic support can be\nextremely welcome for community organisations, along with links beyond the commu-\nnity to other likeminded communities.30 However, such initiatives may also crowd out\nrather than support local activities and there is a fine line between providing support\nand imposing an externally driven agenda. Whilst Hancock and Mitchell identify strong\npatron support within a clear territorial zone as critical elements of a successful zone of\npeace, this may also have its costs in the form of genuine bottom-up approaches when\nthat patron, for example a NGO, has its own strong agenda.\n\nCote d\u2019Ivoire\n\nIt is important to understand the history and the nature of violence in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to\nbetter understand how these communities in zones of peace look like. The civil war\nstarted on 19 September 2002. The government of Laurent Gbagbo, in power since\n2000, was threatened by a rebellion in the North and the West and the country became\ndivided into three areas. A reconciliation process under international auspices was\nstarted in 2003 and a government of national unity was formed in 2005. Elections\nwere finally organised in November 2010. The disputed result led into a full-scale\nmilitary conflict between forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo and supporters of the inter-\nnationally recognised president-elect Alassane Ouattara. In terms of violence intensity,\nthe situation was critical in 2002 and in 2011. In-between, it was very much a no peace,\nno war situation. One could distinguish two main forms of violence, an urban one that\nmostly involved militias and a rural one (\u2018sons of soil\u2019), which occurred in the Western\npart of the country. The distinction between urban and rural forms of violence is\nimportant as rural violence was continuous and mostly between civilians while urban\nviolence was more linked to key political events (especially in 2002 and 2011).\n\nWe will show various type of local peacebuilding initiatives in the most violent zones\nin Cote d\u2019Ivoire, which is the Western region along the Liberian border. They were five\npro-government militias in the region: the Alliance Patriotique W\u00ea (AP-W\u00ea), the Forces\nde Lib\u00e9ration Du Grand Ouest, the Mouvement Ivoirien pour La Lib\u00e9ration de l\u2019Ouest de\nLa C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Union Des Patriotes pour La R\u00e9sistance Du Grand Ouest (UPRGO)\nand the Liberian-backed LIMA forces. In terms of anti-government forces, the initial\n\n27Idler et al, \u2018Peace Territories\u2019.\n28See Hancock & Mitchell (eds), Zones of Peace, and Mitchell and Hancock, Local Peacebuilding for good examples of\nthis, particularly the chapter by Warfield and Jennings in Local Peacebuilding. The literature tends to be dominated by\npeople who have been active in this area, and so, there is a practicality about their approaches.\n\n29Mitchell and Hancock, Local Peacebuilding, even ends with a call for complementarity.\n30Gray, V., \u2018Nonviolence and Sustainable Resource Use with External Support: A Survival Strategy in Rural Colombia\u2019 in\nLatin American Perspectives 39, no.1 (2012): 43\u2013114.\n\nPEACEBUILDING 77\n\n\n\nthree militias, Mouvement Patriotique pour La C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mouvement Populaire\nIvoirien Du Grand Ouest and the Mouvement pour La Justice et La Paix, merged into\none force in February 2003, called Forces Nouvelles (FN). The Dozos, a traditional\nhunter\u2019s society, were also a key ally to the FN.\n\nThese zones of peace consist of different types of communities. Let us first focus on\nrural communities. It is important to understand that the land issue became politicised\nbefore the war started. Confronted with unemployment in Abidjan and other major\ncities, the youth returned to the West to discover that their families\u2019 land had been\nleased or sold, creating many tensions between the autochthones and the migrants. The\ntemptation by this group to regain control of what they saw as their land created many\nconflicts with the migrants (see Allouche & Zadi, 2013).\n\nSome rural communities realised the potential of land-related violence as soon as the\nwar started in 2002 and putting in place clear and consensual mechanisms for the usage\nof land. This was the case of the village of Yacoli Dabouo, a large village of 7000\ninhabitants located in the department of Soubr\u00e9. A village council, representing the\ndifferent communities, was put in place, to sensitise about the illegal nature of selling\nland. All the land-to-land management and tenure transactions were administered and\nrecorded by the management committee and then sent to the sub-prefect office for\nregistration. This means that any point of discords happening after these transactions\ncan be arbitrated by the sub-prefect office in a more transparent and neutral way.\n\nThe village went even further as the problem was not just about land tenure but also\nyouth employment. Since their elders had sold land to incomers, the village council\nnegotiated an agreement with the incomers whereby one-third of the land was given\nback to the youth. All the parties, whether the youth or the incomers, benefited from\nthe NGO OUYINE (which was created by Zadi Kessy Marcel, the current president of\nthe Economic and Social Council in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who was originally from this village),\nwhich distributed hevea plans to everybody and a new rubber treatment factory was\ninstalled by Zadi Kessy Marcel, to thank the community for the agreement (Zadi &\nSohou, forthcoming). As a result, since 2010, there has been no reported incident in this\ncommunity, whether between the youth groups of the different ethnic communities or\nwhen the armed forces of Ouatarra were marching down towards Abidjan.\n\nOther rural communities were more reactive. Forms of violence occurred but quick\nresolution mechanisms were put into place to facilitate the return of expelled commu-\nnities. This is what happened in Guidouba\u00ef. In December 2002, many land labourers,\nwho had migrated to the area for decades, were expelled. A meeting was organised in\nFebruary 2003 with all the traditional chiefs and representatives of the various ethnic\ngroups at Guidouba\u00ef. The sacrifice killing of a beef was an important symbolic moment\nin containing the tensions as this sacrifice was sending an important message in the W\u00e8\nculture and traditions. Following the meeting, many of the Baoul\u00e9 that had run away\ncame back to their plantations.31 The situation remained stable even during the 2011\ncrisis. Like in Yacoli Dabouo, the resolution was made possible through the contribu-\ntion and leadership of an influential man who was coming from this village.\n\nAnother similar initiative was organised by Yahi Octave through his NGO, Nouvelle\nFamille, in the villages of Sokoura and camps in Japon and other villages located in the\n\n31Interview with Yahi Octave, 18 December 2015, at San Pedro, Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\n78 J. ALLOUCHE AND P. JACKSON\n\n\n\nprotected forest of Gouindebe Zagn\u00e932 to facilitate repatriation. In the village of\nSokoura (in the protected forest of Sio, next to Bedi Gouazon), the security was ensured\nby local \u2018rebels\u2019 and the overall security depended on the gendarmes of Man (controlled\nby rebels at that time) rather than those of Guiglo even though it was under Guiglo\u2019s\njurisdiction. The chief of the Burkinabe community in Guiglo, Ki Jacques, helped to\norganise the visit in 2009. Celebrations including the killing of a beef was organised to\nreceive Yahi Octave with his delegations. In this village, it was the opposite; it was the\nautochthones which had been expulsed in 2003. These various local peacebuilding rural\ninitiatives around Guiglo and Tai were not the sole activity of one person, but the name\nof Yahi Octave was repeated several times in interviews.33\n\nIn urban areas, the peace-led initiatives had a different dynamic. Religious commu-\nnities were the most active. In Abidjan, three days of fast and one day inter-faith\nmeeting was organised at the central stadium in January 2003, which was also attended\nby the president Gbagbo. Many other events were organised just after violent clashes,\nfollowed by joint declarations by the leader of the catholic and Muslim community, the\narchbishop Bernard Agre and the Iman Idriss Koudouss. With the national reconcilia-\ntion underway from 2005 onwards, the Catholic Church and Islamic institution were\neven more active, especially with the Catholic Church\u2019s Justice and Peace commission,\nwhich organised many campaigns for peace and reconciliation. For the 2010 presiden-\ntial electoral campaign, Catholic Church and Islamic leaders created the collectifs Des\nreligieux pour Des \u00e9lections apais\u00e9es. In urban settings, these national initiatives took the\nform of visits by Christians in mosques or the opposite, or football matches between\npriests and imams.\n\nThere were many locally driven initiatives. On the 26 February 2005, a local\nChristian Islamic committee was created in the town of Man, which was a very active\ncommittee with many joint activities around social cohesion, peace prayers and con-\ndolence visits (Miran-Guyon, 2015: 121). Another similar local committee was created\nin the Bandama region under the auspices of Monseigneur Simeon Ahouna (Miran-\nGuyon, 2015: 130). In Du\u00e9kou\u00e9, where the tensions were very high, the apostle Georges\nKohikan Gbeno of the Pentecost church started dialoguing with Muslim leaders from\n2007 onwards to preach disarmament and peace. This last example is particularly\ninteresting as the evangelist church was linked to the Gbagbo regime and was not\nknown for its moderate positions (although of course there are many different types of\nchurches under evangelism). Besides, religious figures were involved in social cohesion\nprogrammes and peace committee funded by donor programmes. Iman Dosso\nMamadou, the Iman of the Cite mosque based in Sogefia in San Pedro, was a member\nof the GTZ peace and development committee and was very active in his community.\nDuring the post-electoral crisis in 2011, he realised how explosive the situation could\nbecome as most of the youth were armed following the departure of the security forces.\nHe created his own disarmament programme by asking all the youngsters to deliver\ntheir arms to his house.\n\nThe town of Gagnoa is an interesting example in both showing how members of the\ncommunity were active in creating an island of peace but at the same time showing how\n\n32Interview with Yahi Octave, op. cit.\n33Interview with Ki Jacques, 10/02/2012 and Nemaigny Glacel and Kamand\u00e9 Herv\u00e9, Youth leaders in Guiglo, 11/02/2012.\n\nPEACEBUILDING 79\n\n\n\nfortunate circumstances helped this zone to exist. Mr Gauze Emmanuel Desire, the\nformer Sub Governor of Gagnoa, intervened following a major incident in town during\nthe post-electoral crisis in 2011. A young Baoule peasant was burnt by the Young\nPatriots. Following his intervention, the Sub Governor managed to find a negotiated\nsolution between the different communities (Allouche & Zadi, 2013). The situation\nbecame even more explosive situation as the security forces had deserted their barracks\nand the youth from both political wings had stolen all the arms. What happened was\nthat robbery in the major shop of the town became more attractive for both youth\ngroups and acted as a factor for peace. The situation could have easily degenerated but\nboth groups were together in the shop and all became young individuals interested in\nimmediate material gain rather than political confrontation.\n\nThe situation overall in urban settings were more complex and volatile. While\nviolence was more prone in rural settings, the issue was largely with respect to land\ntenure agreements and conflict resolution mechanisms. In urban settings, the influence\nof national politics and networks made it more unstable. The case of the town of\nDu\u00e9kou\u00e9 is an interesting case to point out. Religious institutions were quite active as\nhighlighted above. But they were other types of spiritual conflict resolution mechan-\nisms. Violent tensions emerged on 3 January 2011 when 32 people were killed after a\nGuinean woman was assassinated. Ahoua Toure and Yahi Octave convened a large\nmeeting with representatives of the different ethnic groups and religious communities.\nOn 4 January, Yahi Octave went to the central mosque and explained the mystical\norigins of the town of Du\u00e9kou\u00e9 in an effort to suppress identity divisions. He recalled\nthat their elders decided to do a human sacrifice around the Guemon Lake and that the\nyoung virgin girl sacrificed was of Senufo origin. By this mystical tale, he was showing\nhow the town was built on the blood of this young girl and that the violence was now\nkilling again this young girl. Migrants and non-migrants had built together this town.\nHowever, two months later, nothing could be done to stop one of the biggest massacres\nof the post-electoral crisis in Cote d\u2019Ivoire.34\n\nThe other criticism to this analysis is that the divide between urban and rural\ndynamics should not be exaggerated as both worlds are connected. In fact, there were\nalso local peace initiatives that were trying to build new ties between rural areas\nsurrounding the urban centres. Some members of the Guiglo community in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire were reaching out to other villages. For example, the initiative in the\nSoukoura village was followed 2 weeks later, by a visit from the leaders of the village\nat Guiglo, thereby breaking the silos and helping to restore the trust between these\ndifferent geographical communities.\n\nThe relationships between these peace initiatives in communities and armed groups\nare interesting in many ways. In the Western region of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, one obvious link\nhas been Yahi Octave. He is a man of paradox. While he was active in trying to create a\ndialogue between the different opposing parties and facilitating the creation of zones of\npeace, he was the leader of a militia (UPRGO). The objective of the militia was to\nrecreate stability and expulse Liberian mercenaries that stayed in the region after the\n2002 war. The movement contributed to the security of the area. However, certain\n\n34www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2011/04/02/des-affrontements-ont-fait-au-moins-800-morts-a-duekoue-selon-le-cicr_\n1502042_3212.html#ens_id=1476585.\n\n80 J. ALLOUCHE AND P. JACKSON\n\nhttp://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2011/04/02/des-affrontements-ont-fait-au-moins-800-morts-a-duekoue-selon-le-cicr_1502042_3212.html#ens_id=1476585\nhttp://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2011/04/02/des-affrontements-ont-fait-au-moins-800-morts-a-duekoue-selon-le-cicr_1502042_3212.html#ens_id=1476585\n\n\nelements, in particular those under the supervision of Banao in Du\u00e9kou\u00e9, became much\nmore radicalised, they were more aggressive than defensive and committed a number of\nacts of violence leading to many deaths.35 This paradox between leading both peace and\nwar initiatives is well explained in the following quote by Yahi Octave himself when\nattacks happened in 2005 in the villages of Guitrozon and petit-Du\u00e9kou\u00e9, declaring \u2018we\nare not attacking. We are resisting. When there are no rebel attacks, we do nothing.\nSome are even in the fields. We do not have the time and the means to attack; however,\nonce we are attacked, we will defend ourselves.36 Yahi Octave also created a local NGO,\nNouvelle Famille, to have more freedom and manoeuvre as some of his different\nreconciliation initiatives were not appreciated and supported by other political leaders\nin the region. Of course, one could argue that this approach started in 2006 when it\nbecame clear that a local political settlement would prevail over a military one. Yahi\nOctave represents an interesting example of the fluidity of individual trajectories during\nconflicts and the importance of agency within networks of peace and conflict. It is not\nuncommon for individual agents to change sides, become agents of violence and also\nfor peace at different points of the conflict. Octave is not just a peace leader, he was a\npolitician and a war hero, he had legitimacy amongst fighters as well as local traditional\ncommunities and was able to use this legitimacy to act as an agent between different\ngroups.\n\nBut the relationships between these peace initiatives in communities and armed\ngroups are more complex than this example may appear to prove. Relationship may\nnot be the right word. Armed actors were not clearly separated from rural or urban\ncommunities. Armed actors were not necessarily organised and seen as an obvious\ncontact point. In rural areas, this distinction was even more porous and they were no\nclear examples of relationship between these locally driven initiatives and armed actors.\nThe final factor to consider is also the chronology of the conflict and the motivation of\nthese militias and armed forces. Many of the militia members in 2010 and 2011 were\ndisillusioned and lacked motivation. In Gagnoa, the Disarmament Demobilization and\nReintegration failed to deliver promises of training and indenisation and the militias\nbecame less ideological. Communities included armed individuals decided to distance\nthemselves from a war that is not theirs and act to redeem their right to live peacefully.\n\nThis relates to our last point of analysis which is about how the peace processes in\nthese zones of peace were driven. Many of these local peace processes were internally\ndriven but it is important that micro-level histories do not ignore the national environ-\nment\u2019s role in shaping and containing violence. First, chronologically, it is important to\nunderstand that from 2005 onwards until the post-electoral crisis in 2011, the political\ndynamics operating in the country were more peaceful, with the constitution of a\ncoalition government in 2005, although the underlying tensions were still present. A\nsecond factor has been that the violence of the 2011 post-electoral crisis was limited to\ntwo key geostrategic areas, the town of Du\u00e9kou\u00e9 and the capital city. Military violence\nin this sense was limited as there were no direct confrontations between the New Forces\nand the army that was under the orders of Gbagbo.

Following the loss of the town, many armed\ngroups started to fear the power of the Dozos and their mystic powers. Similar to in\nSierra Leone, these groups were believed to have magical powers to become invisible\nsoldiers. After the first battle in Du\u00e9kou\u00e9, one should not underestimate the impact of\nfear and rumours on the logic of the restraint of violence.\n\nFinally, it is important to question this external/internal dichotomy as proposed by\nIdler et al. In many of these peace zones, the most influential person was an \u2018influential\nnational outsider that was an insider\u2019. This was the case of Zadi Kessy Marcel or Yahi\nOctave who lives in the capital city or regional towns but that had strong connections\nwith their native villages. Or in other cases, these were externally appointed insiders,\nwhether as sub-governors or as religious leaders.\n\nSierra Leone\n\nIn Sierra Leone, diamonds played a central role at the onset and throughout the civil\nwar and, in some communities, were reportedly used to buy peace, something that is\nfrequently reported by former combatants.37 One documented example relates to a\ndiamonds-for-peace arrangement but also to the continuing operation of local diamond\ntrading in Kenema throughout the war, as a way to facilitate the transfer of diamonds to\nglobal diamond markets.38 The Kenema \u2018island of peace\u2019 rested on the uneasy assump-\ntion that mining and trading in diamonds was more profitable than conflict.\nGovernment-supported Kamajor militia (CDF) and RUF fighters were reported to be\nmining together and then trading in town. The Government threatened to raise taxes\nand make this difficult but government inspectors were then paid off as a \u2018contribution\nto the war effort\u2019.39 In other words, Kenema managed to survive as a peaceful space\nbecause it was useful to both sides, and the cost of taking the city was greater than the\nbenefits of keeping the diamond trade going. The diamond-trading rebels have an\ninterest in maintaining the status quo in order to facilitate access to diamond markets\nand supplies but also because many of them had family in the city, producing a\nstalemate that suited both sides. It also talks to the core motivation of some of the\nrebel groups and their interest in mining rather than any broader ideological aims.\n\nAfter the collapse of the first set of peace agreements,40 in the withdrawal of the\nEconomic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and the\nNigerian peacekeepers, Kenema was garrisoned by around 800 unarmed Sierra Leone\n\n37The author carried out extensive fieldwork in the countryside between 2002 and 2005 where this was frequently\nraised in conversation \u2013 \u2018oh yes, we knew he was RUF, but he came in to town to sell diamonds\u2019.\n\n38These arrangements in Kenema are partly documented by UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper in \u2018Diamonds buy peace for\nSierra Leone city\u2019, 24 June, 2000, http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/24/sierraleone, although the author\nwas also in Kenema shortly after this episode. The peace referred to is both the peace at the local level but also the\nfact that the Lome Peace Accord led to several RUF leaders being incorporated in to Government at this time. That\npeace was relatively short lived. There were other activities taking place in the town, including peace education by\nthe INGO World Vision (Concord Times (Freetown) 31 July, 2000). This is also mentioned in the USAID Field Report of\nJuly 2000 available at https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/usaid-field-report-sierra-leone-jul-2000.\n\n39This was reflected across several different interviews during fieldwork immediately after the war between 2002 and\n2005 in several districts across Sierra Leone but is little documented. There is some mention of these rather unstable\narrangements within the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Report, available here http://www.sierraleonetrc.org/\nindex.php/view-the-final-report/download-table-of-contents.\n\n40Allouche, J., \u2018Politics, exit strategy and political settlement in Sierra Leone: a critical analysis of a laboratory\nexperiment (1991\u20132015)\u2019, Conflict, Security and Development 17, no.3 (2017): 225\u201346.\n\n82 J.

The Ghanaians were amongst the best\ntroops that faced the rebels during the ECOMOG intervention and had an excellent\nreputation. Disciplined, well-armed and well trained, the Ghanaians, supported by local\nCDF, had already proved that the RUF could not take Kenema without a fight.\nHowever, this situation suited the local conditions and Kenema benefitted from a useful\nstand-off whereby both sides could come in to the town to trade diamonds.41 There are\nother examples of local deals being done that were essentially commercial deals or a\nform of buying peace with diamonds but most are verbal examples of this type of\nactivity and not documented, even though they are thought to be widespread during the\nwar.42\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the leader of the Organisation for Peace, Reconciliation and\nDevelopment Sierra Leone (OPARD-SL), Mukson Sesay, played a key role in facilitating\npeacebuilding in Mile 91,43 which represented another island of peace during the war.44\n\nThe success of OPARD during the war in brokering peace at the local level was in no\nsmall way down to the skills and background of Mukson Sesay, who, like many\nmembers of OPARD who had close relationships with RUF rebels, was a former\ncombatant himself. Sesay had been head of a rebel group called G5 that had enjoyed\nconsiderable power during the war, managing movement of civilians between villages\n(Keen, 2005). This meant that Sesay and others were very well connected in the RUF\npersonally and were able to use those contacts to broker peace between the UN and the\nRUF in 2000. A group committed to peacebuilding after their experiences, OPARD was\nable to broker a significant peace agreement at Komrabai and also to negotiate the\nopening of the main road between Mile 91 and Magburaka for the transportation of\nfoodstuffs. OPARD is located in Mile 91 and exists to facilitate peacebuilding. Critically,\nOPARD existed during the war and played an important role in facilitating the 8\nDecember 2000 meeting between RUF and UNAMSIL that aided the peace process\noverall. This meeting was held at Robis Ferry junction between Mile 91 and Magburaka\nand is held to be so significant that it now has a peace monument. Mile 91 itself was\nattacked by the RUF some 19 times during the war and with the nearby road junction at\nMasiaka, subjected to several changes of control.45\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the Sulima Fishing Community Development Project (SFCDP)\ndeveloped alternative local judicial mechanisms during the war. The SFCDP was\noriginally established in the extreme Southern district of Pujehun on the border with\nLiberia on the coast. Pujehun was marginalised for years before the war started in 1991\nfollowing an earlier conflict in 1982, known as the Ndogboyasi War, where the ruling\n\n41Field interviews, March 2002, Kenema.

They got 91 mi and\nstopped, where a sizeable terminus built up. Strategically, it is therefore important in its own right as a strategic\njunction linking Freetown with Makeni and Bo.\n\n44OPARD maintains a detailed website here http://www.insightonconflict.org/conflicts/sierra-leone/sierra-leone-peace\nbuilding-organisations/opard-sl/.\n\n45The author visited Mile 91 several times between 2002 and 2012, interviewing local chiefs and chiefdom treasury\nclerks in March, April and May 2004 and then local government officials in September 2004 and January and February\n2005.\n\nPEACEBUILDING 83\n\nhttp://www.insightonconflict.org/conflicts/sierra-leone/sierra-leone-peacebuilding-organisations/opard-sl/\nhttp://www.insightonconflict.org/conflicts/sierra-leone/sierra-leone-peacebuilding-organisations/opard-sl/\n\n\nAll People\u2019s Congress unleashed a \u2018special squad\u2019 of customs police against the fishing\ncommunity.46 There was no reconciliation following this violence and consequently\nmany local people were amongst the first to join the RUF in 1991. The peace accords of\n1996 led to the kamajors taking control of Pujehun district, but the 1997 coup led to\nexile for many pro-RUF and local leaders of the project and the marginalisation of the\ntraditional Paramount Chiefs system.\n\nHowever, in the refugee camps in Liberia, the SFCDP regrouped and held a series of\ncommunity meetings in the camps along the Liberian border in order to prepare for\ntheir return to Pujehun. This consisted of needs analysis and reconciliation between\ngenerations, and between RUF and non-RUF. Consequently, when the refugees\nreturned following the end of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council junta in 1998,\nthe community was able to take a role in tackling issues like community dispute\nresolution, \u2018palavers\u2019,47 youth misbehaviour, the degraded system of chieftaincy and\nconflicts between returnees and those who stayed behind.48\n\nThe SFCDP works through peace monitors and there is one monitor for each section\nof the Chiefdom to resolve disputes and for early intervention to prevent conflicts.\nThere are also grievance committees and local cases are brought to this committee for\narbitration. The 12 peace monitors work for 10 days each month for a small stipend and\nare also usually respected Koranic scholars.49 Where there are local grievances over\ndrug abuse, land issues, family matters, etc., the people prefer to go to the peace\nmonitors over courts. One side effect of this is that the local administration is hampered\nin its functioning because it cannot gather sufficient revenue to function effectively \u2013\nand this also leads to resentment of local officials. It costs 10,000 Leones ($4) to go to\nthe Native Authority Courts but peace monitors are free.50\n\nThe social upheaval involved in the conflict had led to a significant change in\nlegitimacy at local level and the usurping of chiefs as the only conflict resolution vehicle\n\u2013 essentially the war had led to the emergence of new leaders at community level. Social\ncohesion was certainly enhanced by the fact that this community is overwhelmingly\nMuslim and that the infrastructure had been in decay since before the initial war in\n1982, so the community felt quite isolated from the rest of the country.51 The leaders\nwho emerged from this situation were all proposed locally and then given training in\nconflict resolution whilst in exile in Liberia. These people then became the location of\nchoice for local dispute resolution rather than the native courts, bypassing traditional\nsocial hierarchies upheld by the chiefs. These \u2018peace monitors\u2019 are able to intervene at a\nlocal level to prevent conflict escalation, are able to talk and negotiate with all sides and\neven able to call on additional support with bigger disputes between villages.

The Bo Peace and\nReconciliation Movement, for example, is a coalition of 11 community groups working\non conflict prevention and mitigation and its 20 peace monitors resolve conflicts\nranging from family matters through to land cases and leadership disputes (they\nhandled 255 cases in 2004 alone) and the evidence shows that they have certainly\nhelped with reintegration of former combatants and also in reducing recourse to\nlitigation in local courts.53\n\nConclusions: what might an African approach to zones of peace look like?\n\nThis article has used six examples where civilians have managed to prevent, or at least\ndelay violent conflict. The nature of the examples does mean that there are limitations\nwith regard to generaliseable conclusions, but we remain convinced that they should be\nnot ignored as a result. The literature on civil wars is notably quiet on instances where\nthere have been lulls in the fighting, \u2018islands of peace\u2019 or \u2018zones of peace\u2019. The six\nexamples outlined in this article can be arranged around the three subgroups proposed\nby Idler et al.54: the characteristics of the civil resistance movement in the peace\nterritory, the relationship of the community with armed actors, and the role of external\nactors.\n\nWhere local peace efforts were successful, even in the short term, there was an\nalignment of factors that supported a particular set of agreements that reduced violence.\nWhilst certainly not constituting peace processes in a lasting sense, all of the cases may\ncontribute to ideas of how civilians can achieve peace for periods of time during a war.\nThe Ivorian village of Yacoli Dabouo could constitute a longer term agreement where\nthe work of a local notable, Zadi Kessy Marcel, could be said to constitute a real process\nwhich prevented land-related violence by putting in place clear and consensual\nmechanisms for the usage of land.\n\nWhat is clear from each of these cases is how war in many ways represents violence\nagainst social structures.55 Our research certainly complements other research in\nLiberia and Nigeria that shows that civilians can affect conflict and violence if they\nenjoy sufficient legitimacy and authority.56 The presence of violent actors who are\ncapable of defeating civilians does not mean that they will act upon that. Legitimacy\nand authority derive from their embeddedness within local institutional structures, the\nability of big men to act and shape those structures and the relationship of the\nparticular community with the armed actors. There is therefore an alignment of agency\nand structure that does not speak to a simple dichotomy between them.\n\n52Richards, Fighting for the Rain Forest; Jackson, P., \u2018Chiefs, Money and Politicians: Rebuilding Local Government in Sierra\nLeone\u2019, Public Administration and Development 25 (2005): 48\u201358; Jackson, P., \u2018Reshuffling an old deck of cards?

In the absence of formal state control, the simple binary\nbetween \u2018government\u2019 and \u2018rebel\u2019 does not always hold true in either case that we\nexamine here, with considerable shifts in the makeup of each side throughout the wars\nin question. The characteristics of each force, of the war itself and the political order\nduring wartime, are shaped by the political relationships between the contenders.\n\nAll of these instances of localised peace are not just internally driven. They all closely\nrelate to the nature and willingness of the violent movement to accommodate or resist\nthem. The RUF in Sierra Leone were not capable of entirely controlling Pujehun or\nKenema in the face of resilient, well organised and coherent opposition. It was far less\ncostly to them to come to an accommodation with the local leadership and essentially\nleave them alone. Violent movements like rebel groups cannot maintain order for long\nperiods of time through coercion alone.57 Rebels must take into consideration the\ndemands made by local populations to secure loyalty at least partly because challenges\nto power may be more costly than inclusion in decision making but also because mass\nkilling of civilians is expensive and potentially counter-productive. It must also allow\nfor the organisation of resistance in the form of defence militias and local volunteer\nforces that may be more capable than many rebel groups. Certainly, the government-\naligned militias in Sierra Leone and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire were able to insert themselves into\nlocal networks of violence and change the nature of the social structures surrounding\nthe civilian population both in terms of enhancing customary authorities but also by\nproviding a space where the rebel army and forces could not guarantee victory. This\ncreates space for negotiation between civilian and violent groups that may include a\nwide spectrum of activity ranging from collusion to outright resistance.\n\nThe nature of the wars themselves in both C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone was\nextremely fluid, subject to rapid change and included actors who may have been acting\nfor both sides. In this way, the nature of zones of peace within West Africa differs from\nthe Colombian examples that inform the literature on zones of peace. In particular, the\nlong-term nature of the Colombia war provides a far more stable framework, no matter\nhow violent, for developing lasting zones of peace, whereas the examples drawn from\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone are invariably short term and unstable over time. This\nreflects the fluid and unpredictable nature of the warring parties, the fact that there\nwere no \u2018front lines\u2019 and the conflicts themselves tend to comprise series of social\nconvulsions rather than prolonged ideological struggles. This means that the more\ntemporary zones in Africa are far less institutionalised that those in Colombia and\nperhaps more reliant on a few central factors, including the power of individual agents\nto broker short-term deals, temporary financial arrangements that reflect the aims of\nsome rebels and redistribution of some resources, including land, to allow the diffusion\nof conflict.\n\n57Wood, E., Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 03); Arjona,\nA., \u2018Civilian Resistance to Rebel Governance\u2019, Households in Conflict Network Working Paper 170, February (2014),\nUniversity of Sussex www.hicn.org; Mampilly, Z.C., Rebel Rulers: Insurgent Governance and Civilian Life during War\n(Chicago: Cornell University Press, 2011).\n\n86 J.
