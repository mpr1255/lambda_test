This article is an open access publication\n\nAbstract This article examines the participation and agency of young non-state actors \n(NSAs) in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It \nutilizes the constituency of Youth NGOs: YOUNGO, as a case study to examine the rela-\ntionship between selection of participatory strategies, power sources (following Nasiritousi \net\u00a0 al. in Int Environ Agreem Politics Law Econ 16(1):109\u2013126, 2016), recognition and \nagency using ego and alter perceptions. It finds that young people\u2019s selection of participa-\ntory strategies and power sources is shaped by the level of agency which they perceive \nto be available to them. When self-perception of agency is high, young participants offer \nconstructive policy amendments which can lead to recognition and agency, though only \nwithin certain policy areas and the silos in which they are negotiated. When self-perception \nof agency is low, youth interpret this as lack of recognition, leading to efforts to assert their \nrelevance and/or to challenge procedural legitimacy: neither of which are well received \nby decision-makers. In reality, several of the challenges faced by young participants are \nnot structurally unique to their constituency; however, their lack of financial resources \ndoes hinder their ability to fully utilize modes of participation which previous studies have \nfound to be beneficial to other NSAs, such as side-events. Financial constraints also restrict \nthe ability of youth participants, many of whom are volunteers, to develop professional \nrelationships with key actors over time, meaning that the level of agency developed by \nmore established, better-resourced NSAs remains largely out of reach. These findings have \nimplications for the understanding of NSA agency, which has previously been treated as \nhomogeneous and raises further questions regarding procedural legitimacy of the UNF-\nCCC and its role in mobilizing and empowering the next generation.\n\nKeywords Agency\u00a0\u00b7 Youth\u00a0\u00b7 Participation\u00a0\u00b7 UNFCCC \u00a0\u00b7 Non-state actors\u00a0\u00b7 Power sources\u00a0\u00b7 \nClimate\u00a0Change\u00a0\u00b7 Governance\n\n * Harriet Thew \n H.Thew@Leeds.ac.uk\n\n1 Sustainability Research Institute, School of\u00a0Earth and\u00a0Environment, University of\u00a0Leeds, \nLeeds\u00a0LS2\u00a09JT, UK\n\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-8671-7595\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/s10784-018-9392-2&domain=pdf\n\n\n370 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe modern world is faced with global environmental challenges of unprecedented pro-\nportions. In response, governments around the world have recognized the importance of \ncooperation, seeking mutually acceptable solutions for the protection of the planet and \nits people. Reaching consensus and initiating state-led action has proven difficult, with \nincreased recognition that multi-actor solutions are required to supplement limited gov-\nernmental resources (Albin 1999). As a result, the number and diversity of Non-state \nactors (NSAs) in global environmental governance is growing and their role is becoming \nincreasingly broad (Albin 1999; Bulkeley and Newell 2015). In recognition of this, many \nintergovernmental processes are encouraging NSA participation, as reiterated in the out-\ncome documents of recent, landmark environmental conferences including Rio+20 and \nUNFCCC COP 21 (United Nations 2012; UNFCCC 2015). As we enter a new, Post-Paris \nera of climate governance, seeking to foster a collaborative, multi-actor approach (Jordan \net\u00a0al. 2015) it is important to assess the level of agency which NSAs possess in the UNF-\nCCC, which retains a central role. Previous studies have attempted this, though despite \nacknowledgement that NSAs are not homogenous, they have focused primarily on larger, \nmore established\u00a0 groups and, consequently, the agency of smaller, less dominant NSAs is \nnot well understood.\n\nThis paper focuses on youth participation in the United Nations Framework Conven-\ntion on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Although recognized as an independent stakeholder \nby Agenda 21 in the 1992 Rio \u2018Earth Summit\u2019 which established the UNFCCC (UNCED \n1992), youth were not officially recognized within climate governance for another seven-\nteen years, gaining constituency status as Youth NGOs or \u2018YOUNGO\u2019 in 2009 (UNFCCC \n2010). Existing literature makes little distinction between different types of NSAs and \ntheir agency, largely treating them as homogenous, with the exception of Heike Schroed-\ner\u2019s study on Indigenous People\u2019s Organizations (Schroeder 2010). As such, the study \nof youth participation and agency is uncharted territory offering significant potential to \nincrease understanding of how agency is experienced differently by heterogeneous NSAs. \nIn the current era of climate governance where NSA participation is seen to be increasingly \nnecessary (Jordan et\u00a0al. 2015), exploring the diverse participatory experiences of diverse \nNSAs is a critical and timely consideration. As the closest living relatives to the \u2018future \ngenerations\u2019 which the UNFCCC seeks to protect, nominal representatives of over 50% of \nthe global population and the generation who will not only be most impacted by climate \nchange but who will also inherit responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0tackling it, the participation and agency \nof youth is a particularly pertinent concern.\n\nThis paper introduces YOUNGO, providing an overview of its\u00a0membership and struc-\nture based on the author\u2019s participation in and observation of the constituency over a six \nyear period. A literature review follows, situating this study within existing research on \nNSA agency in global environmental governance. The qualitative methodological approach \ntaken is then explained, before results are presented, structured around modes of participa-\ntion available to UNFCCC constituencies and utilized by YOUNGO (conference access, \nplenary interventions, high-level meetings, actions, side-events and exhibits). These are \nexplored firstly from a youth perspective and secondly from the perspectives of the deci-\nsion-makers they seek to influence. Following Nasiritousi et\u00a0 al. (2016), the concept of \n\u2018power sources\u2019 is used to assess the sources of authority which youth participants draw \nupon in attempt to increase their agency.\n\n\n\n371Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\nFindings demonstrate that youth utilize all of the modes of participation facilitated for \nthem by the UNFCCC, though their ability to fully engage with them is dictated by availa-\nbility of certain\u00a0power sources, indicating that the potential for agency is not equally avail-\nable to all NSAs in the UNFCCC. The study finds that youth select power sources based on \nthe level of recognition and agency they perceive to be\u00a0offered by any given participatory \nopportunity. State Actor perceptions indicate that certain power sources and strategies do \nnot always have the desired response.\n\n2  Non\u2011state actor agency in\u00a0global environmental governance\n\n2.1  Youth participation in\u00a0the\u00a0UNFCCC \n\nYouth have shown an interest in the UNFCCC since its inception, initially holding external \nconferences and presenting declarations to the Conferences of the Parties (COPs) before \nformally registering\u00a0with the UNFCCC, forming delegations to participate directly, unit-\ning to advocate on behalf of youth and eventually gaining constituency status (UNFCCC \n2010). Membership is open to all, with neither fees nor commitment required, though \nbased on a loose understanding that constituents are under 30 years old. Under-eighteens \nwere only\u00a0 permitted to attend COPs for one day\u00a0 a year, on \u2018Young and Future Genera-\ntions Day\u2019,\u00a0 until rules were changed in 2017 extending access to sixteen and seventeen \nyear olds, though younger children can\u00a0participate in online discussions and external events \nthroughout the year. YOUNGO can be seen as a Transnational Advocacy Network (TAN) \noperating within the UNFCCC. Similarly to other TANs, it brings together large transna-\ntionals with small voluntary organizations, uniting moderate and more radical \u2018insiders\u2019 \nand \u2018outsiders\u2019 (Rodrigues 2003).\u00a0The constituency consists of over forty accredited organ-\nizations, based in over twenty countries (UNFCCC 2014a). These range from small, vol-\nuntary groups such as the UK Youth Climate Coalition and Indian Youth Climate Network \nto large international youth organizations such as the World Organization of the Scouting \nMovement. Additionally, a handful of governmental delegations, including the Netherlands \nand Belgium, have established official youth delegate programs whose participants often \nchoose to work with YOUNGO.\n\nYOUNGO annually elects two Focal Points through an online voting system. Equitable \nrepresentation is a normative concern, addressed, partially, with appointment of a Global \nNorth and Global South Focal Point who take responsibility for liaison with the UNFCCC \nSecretariat but are unpaid and have no leadership mandate. As the majority of YOUNGOs \nare volunteers, investing their own time and money, turnover is high as repeat attendance is \ncostly. Unless they secure employment or sponsorship, most youth are unable to maintain \nlong-term engagement. Financial support often comes with obligations to another constitu-\nency, so although several young people are recruited to work for Environmental NGOs, UN \ninstitutions or governmental delegations, those who remain YOUNGOs are predominantly \nunpaid. Global South youth have particular difficulties in obtaining funding and visas and \ntherefore, in spite of a desire to be more representative, the spokespeople for international \nyouth within the UNFCCC usually come from fairly privileged backgrounds.\n\nYOUNGOs have established approximately twelve policy working groups since gaining \nconstituency status, advocating on issues including adaptation and the UNFCCC\u2019s Article \n6 on climate change education, training, public participation, public access to information \n\n\n\n372 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\nand public awareness, recently rebranded as Action for Climate Empowerment, known as \n\u201cACE\u201d. Working Groups rely upon volunteers to maintain activity during and between con-\nferences, creating challenges in sustaining relationships with decision-makers and retaining \ninstitutional memory. YOUNGOs are bound by the rules of observer participation, able to \nwatch but not participate in negotiations and granted the same participatory opportunities \nas other constituencies. However, their participatory strategies and the level of agency they \npossess is not yet understood, which this paper seeks to remedy.\n\nGlobal environmental governance can occur without NSAs, though several multilateral \nprocesses have elected to include them, creating new modes of participation to support \ntheir involvement (Steffek and Nanz 2008). This is attributable to changing perceptions of \nlegitimacy, as belief in absolute state sovereignty has fallen out of fashion (Keck and Sik-\nkink 1999). Nevertheless, State Actors (SAs) retain the mandate and thus the authority for \ndecision-making within the\u00a0intergovernmental process, so NSAs seek to convince SAs to \nshare or transfer agency to them for the performance of certain tasks (Albin 1999; Dellas \net\u00a0al. 2011).\n\nThis paper follows (Dellas et\u00a0al. 2011; Nasiritousi et\u00a0al. 2016), differentiating between \nactors who have the ability to participate in intergovernmental meetings and agents who \nhave the ability to influence the outcome of these events. Agency can be understood in \nrelation to the governance activities which a particular group of NSAs has gained recogni-\ntion for their potential to perform, as further explained below.\n\n2.2  Transnational advocacy networks and\u00a0modifications\n\nNSAs possess varying levels of resource, capacity and skill, with better-resourced, better-\nnetworked organizations tending to dominate (Albin 1999; Bostr\u00f6m and Hallstr\u00f6m 2010). \nTo increase their agency, many NSAs unite in Transnational Advocacy Networks (TANs) \n(Keck and Sikkink 1999) which span international borders. They share knowledge and \nresources, advocating on shared values, with diverse members shaping and being shaped \nby these networks. As NSAs, they lack the mandate to create intergovernmental policy and \nmust therefore frame their knowledge to appeal to state actors. Their advocacy takes dis-\ntinct forms as identified in Keck and Sikkink\u2019s (1999, p. 95) four part typology:\n\n(a) Information politics, or the ability to move politically usable information quickly and \ncredibly to where it will have the most impact.\n\n(b) Symbolic politics, or the ability to call upon symbols, actions or stories that make sense \nof a situation or claim for an audience that is frequently far away.\n\n(c) Leverage politics, or the ability to call upon powerful actors to affect a situation where \nweaker members of a network are unlikely to have influence; and\n\n(d) Accountability politics, or the effort to oblige more powerful actors to act on vaguer \npolicies or principles they formally endorsed.\n\nNasiritousi et\u00a0 al. (2016) modify this typology, combining it with an agency-focused \nstudy of environmental standard-setting (Bostr\u00f6m and Hallstr\u00f6m 2010), to identify five \n\u2018power sources\u2019 which NSAs draw upon, utilizing their knowledge, membership and \nresources to acquire agency. NSAs are said to have Cognitive Power when they hold rel-\nevant information and have sufficient understanding of a policy process to know when and \nwhere to present it. Leverage Power is held when NSAs have access to policy processes \nand can influence key agents within them, and the Symbolic Power of\u00a0large membership \n\n\n\n373Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\nnumbers and/or perceived moral integrity which can be drawn upon to support their advo-\ncacy claims. Nasiritousi et\u00a0al. (2016) add that NSAs also have Material Power, when they \npossess sufficient financial and material resources to support their advocacy efforts and \nSocial Power when they have access to networks and the ability to be heard within them. \nThis paper uses YOUNGO as a case study to test these five power sources, identifying \nthe strategies employed by young people to wield them and exploring how youth choose \nbetween these power sources depending upon the level of agency which they perceive to \npossess in any given circumstance.\n\nNasiritousi et\u00a0al. (2016) claim that NSAs use \u2018power sources\u2019 to gain agency based on \nrecognition of their ability to perform certain activities which make up their \u2018Governance \nProfiles.\u2019 Following Albin (1999), they identify nine governance activities which NSAs can \ngain recognition for: influencing the agenda; proposing solutions; providing information; \nproviding expertise; raising awareness; implementing action; evaluating consequences of \npolicies and measures; representing public opinion and representing marginalized voices. \nThese are then used to identify the Governance Profiles of NSA groups. Following Arts \n(1998), they state that agency can be understood using ego and alter perceptions to estab-\nlish whether a group has gained recognition for their ability to perform these activities, \nby utilizing their \u2018power sources\u2019. This understanding of agency, followed by this paper, \nis in line with previous studies, including Dellas et\u00a0 al. who claim that, for agency: \u2018the \nimportance of recognition cannot be overstated.\u2019 (2011, p. 93). However, research has yet \nto assess how NSAs choose which power source to draw upon at any given time, which \nstrategies they use to wield a particular power source and which combination of strategies \nand power sources is more likely to lead to recognition and agency.\n\n2.3  NSA participation in\u00a0global climate change governance/UNFCCC \n\nCase-study research on NSAs in the UNFCCC predominantly focuses on the Environmen-\ntal NGO (ENGO) and Business NGO (BINGO) constituencies (Betsill 2008; Gulbrandsen \nand Andresen 2004; Vormedal 2008). It therefore runs the risk of overstating NSA influ-\nence, as these constituencies are larger, more established, better resourced and potentially \nsuffer less from collective action problems than other NSA groupings (Betsill 2008; Hane-\ngraaff 2015). Betsill (2008) found that NSA influence is shaped by the nature of the issue \nbeing discussed (particularly in relation to how contentious it is and whether an NSA group \nhas sufficient financial resource to counteract the influence of oppositional lobbyists) and \nthat the level of technicality associated with a particular negotiation, perhaps unsurpris-\ningly, shapes the level of technical expertise that NSAs need to engage with it. This sug-\ngests that having a range of power sources at their disposal is critical for NSA influence/\nagency but that not all constituencies have equal reserves. Betsill calls for further research \ninto whether the nature of an issue has implications for NSA influence and what the rela-\ntionship looks like between NSA agency and their selection of participatory strategies. She \nalso acknowledges the benefits of sustained participation over time, as illustrated by the \nability of ENGOs to overcome restrictions to observer access (during the Kyoto Protocol \nnegotiations) on account of having pre-established relationships with negotiators. This ena-\nbled them to gain an insider position from which to lobby from, remaining in contact via \ncell-phone to hear and comment on what was happening behind closed doors (Betsill and \nCorell 2008); a valuable route to influence which may not be open to all NSAs (L\u00f6vbrand \net\u00a0al. 2017).\n\n\n\n374 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\nSchroeder and Lovell (2012) identify a series of ways in which NSAs can participate \nin the UNFCCC, from observing negotiations, and engaging in advocacy during informal \nmeetings and social events; to more formalized modes of participation such as attending \nand hosting side-events and exhibits; giving plenary interventions; making written submis-\nsions; holding press conferences and making protests. However, little is known about which \nmodes of participation NSAs favor and why, nor about the relationship between modes of \nparticipation, selection of power sources and the ability of smaller TANs to gain agency.\n\nQuantitative research from Nasiritousi et\u00a0 al. (2016) compliments\u00a0 earlier case studies. \nIn surveys at COP 17 and 18, they asked over 500 SAs and NSAs to select the constitu-\nency which they felt was most significant to the nine aforementioned governance activities. \nHowever, as participants were only able to select one constituency per activity, findings \ndo not reflect that agency can be shared (Dellas et\u00a0al. 2011) and even after emphasizing \nthat attention be paid to smaller constituencies, the Women and Gender, Farmers and \nYOUNGO constituencies were excluded from their research due to space limitations.\n\nOther studies have focused on particular modes of facilitated participation within the \nUNFCCC (Hjerpe and Linn\u00e9r 2010; Hjerpe and Buhr 2014; Schroeder and Lovell 2012), \nwith side-events receiving most attention on account of being deemed the \u2018most visible\u2019 \nform of NSA participation (Hjerpe and Linn\u00e9r 2010). Hjerpe and Linn\u00e9r identify 6 func-\ntions of side-events: building capacity; introducing potential items for negotiation; dissemi-\nnating information; interconnecting people and policy areas; providing a forum for other \nlevels of governance and legitimizing global governance, while Hjerpe and Buhr (2014) \nidentify trends in the way in which climate change has been framed in UNFCCC side-\nevents. These studies suggests that side-events can be a vehicle for NSA agency as attend-\nees benefit from access to up-to-date expertise and networking opportunities while hosts \nare able to introduce new ideas and to frame issues. Hjerpe and Linn\u00e9r (2010) argue that \nside-events benefit the UNFCCC process by increasing perceived input legitimacy through \nseeming inclusion of a wide range of actors. Upon closer inspection, however, they identi-\nfied a lack of diversity in side-event hosts (geographically and epistemologically speaking, \nthey do not engage in age-based analysis) challenging\u00a0the belief expressed by state actors \nin their study that side-events enhance pluralism. This suggests a need to explore how side-\nevents are perceived and utilized by less dominant NSA groups in the UNFCCC, such as \nyouth.\n\nSchroeder and Lovell (2012) suggest that NSAs engage in side-events in order to \u2018be \nvisible and to raise their profile\u2019 (p. 31), indicating that side-events perform a clear func-\ntion in increasing the recognition of NSAs engaged in them. Their study supports Hjerpe \nand Linn\u00e9r\u2019s (2010) argument that side-events can indirectly introduce agenda items by \nacting as an incubator for new ideas, though this process is limited by lack of formal coor-\ndination between side-events and negotiations. Schroeder and Lovell (2012) also propose \nthat the type of NSA hosting the side-event plays a role in the extent to which they interact \nwith the negotiations, suggesting a potential difference in the ability of different NSAs to \nutilize side-events to increase their agency, though this remains unexplored.\n\n3  Methodology\n\nData collection consisted of twenty-three semi-structured interviews, a focus group with \nsixteen participants, and participant observation during the 40th Intersessional of the UNF-\nCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SB40) in 2014. Ego and Alter perceptions (Arts 1998) were used \n\n\n\n375Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\nto compare YOUNGO\u2019s self-perception (ego) with how negotiators and Intergovernmental \nOrganizations perceive them (alter), to assess whether recognition is attained. NSA par-\nticipation at Intersessionals is smaller and less geographically diverse so data collection at \na COP would have been preferable, though all interviewees had attended previous COPs \nand Intersessionals and distinguished between the two types of conference when necessary. \nAs a participant at\u00a0five COPs and five intersessionals, the researcher was also able to draw \nupon personal experience to recognize any differences.\n\nYouth participation at COP 21 was abnormal as a result of unusually high public interest \nwhich increased applications, curtailing quotas for regular participants. This, coupled with \nheightened security following Parisian terror attacks, resulted in an unprecedented number \nof negotiations being closed to observers, negatively affecting youth perceptions of partici-\npation. At SB44, the subsequent conference, there were lingering concerns expressed by \nNSAs, including youth, though discussions around Access to Intergovernmental Meetings \nsuggested an imminent return to \u2018normal\u2019 participation. In recognition of this anomaly, \nonly data from SB40 in 2014 were included in this study.\n\nA balanced sample of alter perceptions were collected from seven Global South and \nseven Global North negotiators from the majority of UNFCCC negotiating blocks: the \nLeast Developed Countries; African Group; Alliance of Small Island States; G77; Euro-\npean Union; Umbrella Group and the Environmental Integrity Group. The majority had \nsubstantial experience and responsibility, several had been participating over 5\u00a0years, a\u00a0few \nfor over ten, and two were Heads of Delegation.\n\nIn recognition that negotiators working on Article 6: the policy on public participation \nmay have differing views to their colleagues on NSA involvement, interviews were sought \nwith both Article 6 and non-Article 6 negotiators. YOUNGO have had a working group \nfollowing Article 6/ACE since 2009 so it is an appropriate policy to analyze their agency. \nArticle 6 and non-Article 6 interviewees were selected from the same delegations or nego-\ntiating blocks for direct comparison, to determine whether policy silos influence percep-\ntions. Of the fourteen negotiators interviewed, six worked on Article 6 and eight did not, \nwith equal Global North and South representation. Interviews were also conducted with \nthree key informants from intergovernmental organizations, all working on Article 6. Inter-\nview classifications are shown in Table\u00a01.\n\nEgo perceptions were collected through six interviews with youth who had attended \nat least two previous UNFCCC negotiations where they had engaged with YOUNGO to \nensure that they had sufficient experience of both UNFCCC participation and YOUNGO \nmembership. Interview duration for both the ego and alter samples ranged from 25 to \n50\u00a0min. Interviews were transcribed and deposited into Nvivo for analysis. However, sev-\neral participants refused to be recorded. In these instances, detailed notes were taken dur-\ning and immediately after each interview which were later typed up and added to Nvivo.\n\nTo increase the ego sample and observe discussions between members regard-\ning their participation, a focus group was also held with sixteen YOUNGOs. Addition-\nally, YOUNGO daily meetings and youth participation in conference proceedings were \nobserved for further triangulation to assess whether their behavior matched the responses \nthey gave during interviews and focus groups.\n\nA grounded approach was taken to generate theory (Charmaz 2014) in Nvivo with \nselective coding applied initially, based on power sources from the literature, e.g., \u2018Moral \nPower\u2019 and Participatory Opportunities within the UNFCCC, e.g., \u2018Interventions\u2019. Open \ncoding was used when new findings were identified and finally axial coding permitted \nidentification of the relationships between participatory opportunities, power sources and \nagency.\n\n\n\n376 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\n4  Results\n\nBy cooperating as a TAN, youth have gained recognition from the UNFCCC Secretariat \nin the form of constituency status. In addition to having conference access, this offers \nthem formal participatory opportunities, which this section explores in turn to consider \nhow they are perceived and utilized\u00a0by youth participants, and the implications of this for \nyouth agency. Based on participant observation, the following modes of NSA participation \nin the UNFCCC have been identified: Access, Plenary Interventions, High-Level Meetings, \nActions, Side-Events and Exhibits.1 These are considered from ego and alter perspectives \nto assess how each shapes youth participation and, which are more likely to lead to recog-\nnition, thus enabling transitions from actors to agents.\n\n4.1  Conference access\n\nAccreditation grants access to the conference, though several negotiations are closed due to \npolitical sensitivity or space limitations. When room capacity is limited, it is common that \neach constituency receives a small number of secondary passes.

At SB40, YOUNGO\u2019s most active policy working group followed Article 6, per-\nceived as particularly open to youth input:\n\nArticle 6 is a good place for youth influence, youth can really help (Interview D2).\n\n They developed relationships with Article 6 negotiators, gaining Leverage Power which \nled to a closed negotiation being opened to observers. As such, they see Article 6 negotia-\ntors as allies:\n\nPeople who work on Article 6 are all friends. They all want the same thing (Inter-\nview D1).\n\n They also perceive that they have a role in its implementation:\n\nI\u2019ve been following Article 6 as that is something we can act on (Focus Group Par-\nticipant)\n\n YOUNGO\u2019s Cognitive and Social Powers are officially acknowledged with in-session \nspeaking opportunities to share their experiences of education, participation and aware-\nness-raising (often focused on social media) in annual \u2018Dialogues\u2019, mandated by the 2012 \nDoha Work Programme on Article 6. Here\u00a0 YOUNGO draws upon Cognitive Power to \nincrease their agency as policy-making advisors and offers Social Power to support aware-\nness-raising efforts.\n\nAll non-youth interviewees were aware that youth have constituency status, which they \ninvariably claimed to be important. They stated that youth participation was crucial for \nprocedural legitimacy4 and longevity, referring to the constituency\u2019s Symbolic Power as \nthe representatives of young and future generations.5 However, this may have been influ-\nenced by researcher positionality, as this was expressed in personal terms:\n\nIt is good for you to be here, I will die and you will take over (Interview B7).\n\nIt is your future not ours (Interview B4).\n\n In spite of this, several negotiators failed to acknowledge any additional value to be gained \nby engaging with youth,6 highlighting that Symbolic Power may be less likely to lead to \nagency, as seen in this interaction:\n\nResearcher: Have you noticed any youth participants here? Negotiator: Not really but \nit is worth them coming. I saw youth make a comment in plenary but I couldn\u2019t listen \n(Interview B7).\n\n2 Focus Group.\n3 Interview E1.\n4 Interviews A1; A3; B7.\n5 Interviews: A3; A4; B4.\n6 Interviews B4; B5; B7.\n\n\n\n378 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\n Some negotiators referred to a need to reach a global climate agreement for, but not with \nyoung people7 expressing well-meaning sentiments which failed to acknowledge that youth \ncould play an active role:\n\nI have children; I know we need to do more (Interview B6).\n\n The value of face to face contact was expressed by one, highlighting that the strategies \nemployed by YOUNGO affect alter perceptions and, in turn, youth agency.\n\nResearcher: Have you been influenced by youth in this process?\n\nNegotiator: No but they have never tried to talk to me (Interview B3).\n\n Those who did recognize an active role for youth described this primarily in relation to \ntheir Cognitive Power,8 as emphasized by Article 6 negotiators:\n\nAn innovative youth movement will always have an impact, we expect new ideas \nfrom them (Interview A3).\n\nA lot of negotiators have been doing this for 20\u00a0years. They aren\u2019t adding anything \nnew (Interview A4).\n\n As perceived by the young participants, decision-makers recognized their Cognitive Power \nin relation to Article 6 policy, which youth have successfully wielded by offering incre-\nmental policy amendments. This includes recognition from IGO representatives as demon-\nstrated in the following quote:\n\nHaving heard the youth statements and seen connections in the text I think it is safe \nto assume that youth influence on Article 6 was adopted by the COP (Interview C1).\n\n This sentiment was shared by negotiators working on Article 6, who emphasized that \nyouth have made specific policy inputs while their ongoing interest in the topic has contrib-\nuted to keeping these issues \u2018alive\u2019, i.e. on the negotiating table.\n\nIn an area where I didn\u2019t have a firm view, a good suggestion from YOUNGO about the \nDoha Work Programme influenced my position and we have that now (Interview A1).\n\nIn some issues, we see more references to and from YOUNGO in the text, especially \non Article 6. Article 6 is still alive partly because of YOUNGO (Interview A2).\n\n Relationships developed over time have led to recognition of individuals and the \nconstituency:\n\n[Name removed] is a good lobbyist. He came to see us with clear suggestions 2 or \n3\u00a0years in a row. The points he made today [listed each point] were very helpful, we \nwill take them on board (Interview A3).\n\nYouth can really have an influence, like today in the Dialogue. Some of their mes-\nsages were very focused, like the one about involving psychologists to create behav-\nioral change (Interview A5).\n\n These quotes emphasize YOUNGO\u2019s use of Cognitive Power, rather than any other power \nsource, suggesting that it is their collaborative input rather than their youth which has led \nto recognition in this policy area. It could be that negotiators who work on the policy on \n\n8 Interviews A1; A2; A3; A4; A5; B1; B2; C1.\n\n7 Interviews: B4; B6; B7.\n\n\n\n379Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\npublic participation are predisposed to be more open to youth suggestions. There were \ntwo anomalies to this hypothesis: Interviewee A6 did not recognize YOUNGO\u2019s contribu-\ntion. On further investigation, it was discovered that while she had been negotiating on the \nKyoto Protocol (the subject of many YOUNGO actions and interventions) for 3\u00a0years, she \nhad only been assigned to Article 6 for SB40. The other anomaly was Interviewee B8. She \nspoke positively of youth participation and was aware of many YOUNGO advocacy mes-\nsages. She negotiated on mitigation and stated that youth had never spoken to her directly \nabout this. However, during post-interview discussion, it transpired that she had previously \nworked on Article 6 for a couple of years. This further corroborates the evidence that it is \nthrough positive engagement with YOUNGOs working on Article 6 over time, that alter \nperceptions have improved, increasing recognition. However, as policies are negotiated in \nsilos, this recognition only extends as far as the decision-makers who are directly involved, \nso YOUNGO\u2019s agency in other policy areas remains low.\n\n4.2  Plenary interventions\n\nYOUNGO\u2019s plenary interventions often draw upon the Cognitive Power of others, rather \nthan offering suggestions based on their own experiences. Youth often use interventions to \ndemonstrate their familiarity with academic material such as IPCC reports. This is regu-\nlarly combined with Symbolic Power, strategically wielded using both representative and \nmoral claims by emphasizing the size and vulnerability of the global youth population.9 \n\nThe IPCC report highlights that climate change is already happening and is exacer-\nbating existing inequalities, with already vulnerable youth being particularly affected. \nAs youth we have the most at stake, therefore we feel we should have a voice on any \npolicies and programs that impact our future (YOUNGO Plenary Intervention).\n\n This reliance on the Cognitive Power of others (such as IPCC scientists) suggests that \nyouth do not perceive their own unique knowledge and experiences to be valued/valuable. \nTheir decision to draw upon Symbolic Power to request additional participatory opportu-\nnities also suggests that they do not perceive this mode of participation to be meaningful. \nThis is based on the belief that plenary interventions offer little opportunity to gain agency, \nas this focus group participant explained:\n\nInterventions show our interest but Parties don\u2019t listen. The format isn\u2019t interactive, \nthey don\u2019t even listen to each other\u2019s and ours are at the end when everyone has left.\n\n As a result, only a third of focus group participants and interviewees10 had contributed to \nYOUNGO interventions, with the majority forgoing this participatory opportunity.\n\nOnly two negotiators interviewed had heard YOUNGO interventions at SB40.11 One, as \nthe meeting Chair could not leave early12 the other had made special effort to stay, indicat-\ning recognition of YOUNGO\u2019s Cognitive Power:\n\nThey only got two minutes. Most delegates just left. I sat and listened and heard them \ntalk about adaptation, mitigation, participation and gender (Interview A4).\n\n9 Participant Observations; Interviews: E1; E2.\n10 Interviews: D1; D3.\n11 Interviews: A4; B2.\n12 Participant Observation.\n\n\n\n380 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\nSeveral negotiators said they found some interventions too negative, indicating that Sym-\nbolic and Accountability Powers may not be the most efficient way to gain recognition13:\n\nSometimes youth can be too aggressive, they should push the limits creatively, not \njust say you need to think about the future. Sometimes we find that arrogant. We have \nchildren too; of course we care about the future (Interview B8).\n\nWhen I see youth taking biased positions I think they don\u2019t understand well enough. \nThey should stay away from blaming (Interview B7).\n\nAn IGO interviewee (C1) commented that interventions are later shared with Parties, \nthough even the more sympathetic negotiators said it was uncommon for Parties to discuss \nthem.14\n\n4.3  High\u2011level meetings\n\nThe UNFCCC Secretariat facilitates meetings between YOUNGO and high-level officials \nsuch as the Subsidiary Body Co-Chairs and Executive Secretary, offering YOUNGO an \nintimate space to talk to influential individuals.15 Preparation is managed online to permit \nnon-attendees to contribute, which YOUNGOs feel increases their Representative Power. \nSome perceive this as a way to develop Leverage Power by gaining key allies16 while oth-\ners attempt to use Symbolic Power, making moral and representative claims about their \nconstituency to put pressure on high-level decision-makers.17\n\nDuring a High-Level meeting at SB40, YOUNGO were permitted to ask three questions, \nsubmitted to the Secretariat for advance approval18 (though no submitted questions were \nrejected). There were high levels of online participation in preparation for this meeting, \nindicating that youth perceive these interactions\u00a0as offering significant potential for agency. \nHowever, this led to internal friction with much debate over which questions to submit. \nSome wanted to wield Symbolic and Accountability Power, claiming the moral high ground \nand questioning the Executive Secretary\u2019s allegiance following her attendance at a recent \ncoal summit. Others disagreed, afraid that this may cost them a powerful ally, reducing their \nLeverage Power.19 This led to the eventual submission of weak questions which all could \nagree upon, paralleling the negotiations themselves.20 There is a danger that internal fric-\ntion will decrease the agency of individuals who choose non-participation over conflict and \nthrough lost time spent on internal debate and missed opportunities to gain high-level allies.\n\nHigh-level decision-makers were unavailable for interview, so whether this combina-\ntion of Leverage, Symbolic and Accountability Powers can be successfully wielded in this \nway is unknown. However, based on personal observation of multiple interactions between \nhigh-level decision-makers and YOUNGO over several years, it is the author\u2019s belief that \nutilizing Cognitive Power to present concrete, policy-relevant solutions is more positively \nreceived than attempts to claim moral superiority, and more likely to lead to the facilitation \nof subsequent meetings of this nature.\n\n15 Interviews C1; D3; E3; Participant Observations.\n16 Interviews D2; D3.\n17 Participant Observations; Interview E1; E2.\n18 Interview D3; YOUNGO 2014.\n19 Participant Observation.\n20 Participant Observation; YOUNGO, 2014; Interview D1.\n\n13 Interviews: A2; B7; B8.\n14 Interviews: A4; A5.\n\n\n\n381Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\n4.4  Actions\n\nYOUNGOs perform demonstrations known as \u2018actions\u2019 in the negotiation corridors, designed \nto attract negotiator and media attention.21 Actions require Material Power for resources, \nthough YOUNGO strives for high impact on a low budget,22 capturing actions on camera to \nshare through social media, subsidizing their limited Material Power with their ample Social \nPower. YOUNGO often also draws upon Cognitive Power in actions, presenting policy-rele-\nvant information in a novel and entertaining format which is often linked to popular culture. \nAt SB40, a youth-led action involved negotiators jumping across pieces of paper labeled with \ntargets which youth would like to see included in Intended Nationally Determined Contribu-\ntions (INDCS) which was loosely themed around the Game of Thrones TV series.\n\nDuring SB40, YOUNGO also supported an ENGO-led action symbolizing a return to \nthe negotiations following a \u2018walk-out\u2019 from the previous COP in Warsaw.23 This was an \nattempt at exercising Representative Power, raising moral concerns that sponsorship from \nhigh-carbon industries (including aviation) was affecting ambition and based on the belief \nthat if NSA\u2019s were seen to leave, the COP would lose legitimacy.24 NSAs made use of their \nperceived role as \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to question the legitimacy of the COP in the eyes of the pub-\nlic, capturing media attention with their mass walk-out.25 Their departure was not perma-\nnent, labeled: \u2018Volveremos\u2019 loosely translating from Spanish as \u2018we will return stronger.\u2019 \nNSAs returned at SB40, holding the logos of many NGOs worldwide to try to maximize \ntheir Representative Power, though in reality, geographical diversity was low due to lack of \nGlobal South NSA attendance at Intersessionals.\n\nActions must be requested 24\u00a0 h in advance\u00a0 (participant observation), must refrain \nfrom\u00a0personal attacks and should not name individual countries or disrespect their flags \n(UNFCCC 2017). Infringement of these rules can lead to loss of accreditation.26 Many \nactions are framed positively, but negativity breeds when NSAs perceive they cannot affect \nthe process in another way.27 Focus Group participants highlighted several concerns:\n\nI would prefer not to do that type of thing; I would rather talk to people directly.\n\nI don\u2019t think they help at all but what else can we do?\n\n When youth perceived that negotiators would not listen to them they resorted to nega-\ntively framed actions, drawing upon their Social and Representative Powers to make moral \nclaims, amplified by the media. At SB44, several\u00a0youth perceived that their agency was \nnegatively affected by business NGOs (BINGO).28 This provoked some to engage in \u2018civil \ndisobedience\u2019 (Interview E1). Youth who see their agency as weak treat their participation \nas a battle29 strategically disrupting the negotiations to challenge procedural legitimacy:\n\nWe needed to do something drastic. There is a system problem. This is a flawed pro-\ncess (Interview E1).\n\n21 Focus Group; Interviews: D2; E1; E2; E3.\n22 Interview E3, Participant Observations.\n23 Participant Observation; Interviews E1; E2; Focus Group.\n24 Interview E1.\n25 Interviews E1, E2.\n26 Interviews E2.\n27 Interview E1; Focus Group.\n28 Interviews E1, E2; Participant Observation; Focus Group.\n29 Interview E1; E2.\n\n\n\n382 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\nOne of the reasons why civil society and youth walked out was because of massive \ncorporate lobbying. We \u2026can\u2019t collaborate with actors who are on a path to destroy \nour future (Participant Observation).\n\n Many YOUNGOs spent large amounts of time attending preparation meetings and creat-\ning paper windmills to hand out during this action.30 However, their input to content was \nlimited:\n\nI don\u2019t know who organized it. Presumably some of the big ENGOs, I don\u2019t know if \nyouth had any input to the messaging or method, all we were asked was how it could \nbe catchy (Interview E1).\n\n No members of ENGO were interviewed, though this indicates that YOUNGO lacks rec-\nognition from other constituencies for their Cognitive Power, though their Social Power \nis valued and utilized. YOUNGOs resort to disruptive strategies (in this case, vocal non-\nparticipation) as a last resort when they perceive that they lack opportunities to gain agency \nthrough facilitated modes of participation. This is a risk as it could lead to loss of accredi-\ntation. Additionally, while collaboration with other constituencies could enable knowledge \nexchange and resource sharing, it could erode youth agency if larger constituencies draw \nupon YOUNGO\u2019s resources without incorporating their views.\n\nMost non-youth interviewees had noticed YOUNGO actions but were unable to recall \nthe content.31 This was also the case for \u2018Volveremos\u2019 as seen in this conversation with a \nnegotiator32:\n\nResearcher: Did you see the action this morning?\n\nNegotiator: Yes, what was it about? I just walked through; I don\u2019t have time to look \nat their faces.\n\n An IGO representative had a similar response: \n\nResearcher: Did you see the action this morning?\n\nIGO: No, what was it about?\n\nResearcher: The walk-out from Warsaw\n\nIGO: Oh yeah, they came back the next day when they realized no-one noticed.\n\nResearcher: They came back today\n\nIGO: Haven\u2019t they been here anyway?\n\nThis indicates that attempts to engage in strategies of disruption or non-participation can \neasily be overlooked and, while they may challenge perceptions of procedural legitimacy in \nthe eyes of the media, this may go unnoticed by decision-makers inside the process. This is \nparticularly likely when other NSAs remain engaged in the negotiations, diverting attention \naway from those who have chosen to withdraw.\n\nIn contrast, actions expressing Cognitive Power were more successful. A Global South \nnegotiator highlighted that some actions helped him to understand aspects of negotiations \nwhich he did not follow personally. He stated that under limited capacity, actions draw \n\n30 Interview E1, Focus Group.\n31 Interviews: A3; A6; B2; B4; B5; B6; B7.\n32 Interview B7.\n\n\n\n383Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\nattention to important issues. He recalled all of the messages from a YOUNGO action at \nSB40, stating:\n\nWhen you see a message it prompts more thoughts. I will share these thoughts with \nmy delegation. The messages from youth help us, we treasure them (Interview A5).\n\n His Head of Delegation later voiced the same sentiment, confirming that the negotiator \nhad indeed shared YOUNGOs policy recommendations.33 This suggests that actions can be \nperceived positively and negatively, depending upon the power sources they draw upon and \nthe strategies they employ. This example highlights that when NSAs gain recognition from \none decision-maker, with effective use of Cognitive Power they may indirectly influence \nothers.\n\n4.5  Side\u2011events and\u00a0exhibits\n\nYOUNGOs can attend and host side-events and exhibits. While these do not feed directly \ninto negotiations, they often share policy-relevant information and enable participants to \nincrease their Social and Cognitive Powers through networking and narrative building. \nYouth recognize their potential to influence other attendees and gain media attention.34 \nHowever, hosting side-events and exhibits requires Social and Cognitive Power to attract \nattendees/visitors and sufficient Material Power to prepare, transport and display resources. \nSufficient certainty of ones own\u00a0 participation is also needed ahead of side-event and \nexhibit application deadlines, certainty which is difficult to attain for\u00a0young volunteers who \nmay\u00a0have to self-fundraise and request time off from their work and studies to attend.\n\nThe young people who participated in this study saw side-event attendance as valuable \nfor their learning. However, only one YOUNGO side-event and one exhibit were hosted at \nSB40, both by the United Nations of Youth Network, with a focus on forest management \neducation (UNFCCC 2014b). YOUNGOs recognize side-events and exhibits as opportuni-\nties for agency but often lack capacity to apply and plan for them in advance, though they \nmay gain speaking opportunities during events organized by other actors.35 As such, it is \napparent that a level of Material Power is required in order to fully utilize these modes of \nparticipation which is more advantageous to better-resourced NSAs.\n\nNo non-youth interviewees had attended YOUNGO\u2019s side-event or exhibit at SB40. \nOnly the negotiators and IGO representative working on Article 6 had ever attended a \nYOUNGO side-event or exhibit.36 Some claimed they were willing but lacked the time.37 \nOthers just did not see it as a priority,38 indicating a lack of recognition of YOUNGO\u2019s \nCognitive Power outside of Article 6 policy.\n\n4.6  Summary of\u00a0results\n\nSee Table\u00a02. \n\n33 Interview B1.\n34 Participant Observation; Interviews D2; E3.\n35 Focus Group; Participant Observations.\n36 Interviews: A1; A2; A3; A4; A5; C1; C2; C3.\n37 Interviews: B2; B6.\n38 Interviews: B4; B7.\n\n\n\n384 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\n5  Discussion\n\nIn response to Michele Betsill\u2019s (2008) call for research into the relationship between NSA \nstrategy selection and influence, this study finds that young people select between partici-\npatory strategies and draw upon certain power sources (Nasiritousi et\u00a0al. 2016) in response \nto the level of agency which they perceive to be available.\n\nWhen youth perceive that they have recognition and can thus expect to be listened to, \nthey draw upon their Cognitive and Social Powers to offer concrete policy suggestions. \nThese are generally well-received, indicating that youth can gain agency within the \n\nTable 2  YOUNGO agency across UNFCCC modes of participation\n\nConference access Young people with UNFCCC accreditation struggle to engage in the process out-\nside of the formal modes of participation facilitated for them by the Secretariat. \nThis is particularly the case for newcomers, overwhelmed by the complex \nUNFCCC process, who may perceive lack of formalized opportunities for them \nto provide input as lack of recognition of their role as relevant stakeholders. \nThis has a negative impact on youth perceptions as they then focus on gaining \nrecognition rather than on more proactive strategies to pursue agency. This \nconstraint is further compounded when negotiators see that young NSAs are \npresent but have limited or negative interactions with them, leading some to \nquestion the role of youth as active participants within the process.\n\nPlenary interventions Young people perceive plenary interventions as offering low potential for agency. \nThis appears to stem from the scheduling of interventions, as youth believe \n(and negotiator A4 confirmed) that when NSA interventions follow Party \ninterventions it is uncommon for decision-makers to remain in the plenary \nhalls to listen to them. Only one participant acknowledged that this problem \nwas not only faced by YOUNGO but also by Parties and other constituencies, \nhighlighting that youth are quick to attribute participatory challenges to lack of \nrecognition. Decision-makers who had heard YOUNGO interventions during \nSB40 responded positively, emphasizing their use of Cognitive Power. How-\never, the responses of those had not stayed behind to hear youth interventions \nillustrated that negative reactions to previous interventions may have influenced \nthis decision.\n\nHigh-level meetings Young people perceive high-level meetings to offer potential for agency. How-\never, disagreements over which power sources to wield cause internal friction \ndue to lack of consensus over whether high-level individuals can be regarded as \nallies or should be held accountable.\n\nActions Young people regularly engage in actions within UNFCCC spaces though they \nhave contrasting reasons for doing so. Several stated that, although they do not \nbelieve actions to be the most effective use of their time, they engage in them \nas a last resort, viewing other channels for agency as being closed to them due \nto perceptions of low recognition. Others believe that actions offer significant \npotential for agency via media coverage, by undermining procedural legitimacy \nand/or exerting external pressure. This view appears to be supported by other \nNSA constituencies, though the indirect approach does not always capture the \nattention of negotiators. In contrast, actions targeted directly at decision-makers \nwithin the process are more likely to increase NSA agency.\n\nSide-events and exhibits Young people perceive that side-events and exhibits offer potential to increase \ntheir agency. However, hosting these modes of participation requires material \nresources which youth struggle to muster. As volunteers, young people, often \nstruggling to fund their own attendance, are unlikely to be able to commit to \nparticipation sufficiently far in advance to meet UNFCCC deadlines for side-\nevent and exhibit applications. As a result, youth-led side-events and exhibits \nare limited in number and the potential\u00a0to utilize this mode of participation \nremains largely unrealized.\n\n\n\n385Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\nUNFCCC, as seen in the Article 6 negotiations. However, when youth perceive that their \npotential for agency is low, it is often based on their interpretation of a structural barrier \n(which may or may not be unique to their constituency, such as the timing of plenary inter-\nventions) as being indicative of a lack of recognition that they are relevant actors within the \nprocess. This often results in youth trying to claim recognition rather than directly pursu-\ning agency. They do this by emphasizing their vulnerability, their links to future genera-\ntions and the large and growing global youth population which they nominally represent. \nAppealing to their Symbolic Power through moral and representative claims is a popular \nstrategy, but alter perceptions suggest that it does not always lead to agency. This may be \ndue to the relative privilege of UNFCCC youth participants, whose vulnerability and rep-\nresentativeness is subject to debate, or because this strategy does not produce concrete, \npolitically feasible solution for policy-makers to utilize within the structural constraints of \nthe UNFCCC.\n\nFrom the alter interviewees\u2019 perspective, while there was some acknowledgement of \nYOUNGO\u2019s Symbolic Power, several interviewees expressed annoyance at youth for utiliz-\ning the speaking opportunities they are given to reiterate why they should be heard, rather \nthan proposing tangible suggestions for policy-makers to act upon. This leads to dimin-\nished recognition of the role which youth can play, which in turn leads youth to believe \nthat their participation is tokenistic. As a result, youth then resort to disruptive strategies, \nattempting to wield their Social, Material and Leverage Powers in order to challenge the \nlegitimacy of the UNFCCC process and the state actors within it. This negatively impacts \nupon their agency as it damages how they are perceived by decision-makers, creating a \ndownward spiral of low self-perception, negative participatory strategies and loss of rec-\nognition. Conversely, when youth perceive their agency to be high they demonstrate their \nCognitive and Social Powers with direct, constructive interactions. This has been critical \nfor youth in gaining recognition, leading to agency in the Article 6 negotiations, and dem-\nonstrates that there is a cyclical relationship between ego perceptions of agency, selection \nof power sources and strategies, recognition from decision-makers and NSA transitions \nfrom actors to agents.\n\nThe modes of participation which the UNFCCC Secretariat facilitates do not increase \nNSA agency unless recognition has already been secured. Without recognition, decision-\nmakers, under time and resource constraints, are unlikely to pay attention to YOUNGO \nas they do not recognize the value in doing so. This is potentially relevant to all UNF-\nCCC constituencies, particularly those with fewer resources who must make strategic deci-\nsions on how best to mobilize their limited Material Power. The young participants of this \nstudy referred to many of the activities identified by Schroeder and Lovell (2012), with \nthe exception of written submissions and press conferences which they did not mention, \nperhaps because these require a level of capacity which they did not possess\u00a0at the time \nof data collection. Their many references to \u2018actions\u2019 builds upon Schroeder and Lovell\u2019s \nbrief mention of \u2018protests\u2019 and demonstrate that this is a particularly important mode of \nparticipation for young people, in spite of mixed perceptions regarding the utility\u00a0of\u00a0 this \nparticipatory\u00a0strategy.\n\nWith the exception of Material Power which they recognize their lack of, youth are \nquick to attribute challenging participatory experiences to lack of recognition rather than \nto lack of power sources. Lack of Material Power compromises their ability to utilize cer-\ntain modes of participation to their full advantage, distinguishing the participatory experi-\nences of youth from that of other groups. This suggests that, although facilitated modes of \nparticipation can help young participants to navigate the complex UNFCCC process by \n\n\n\n386 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\nproviding structured entry points, modes which require a certain level of Material Resource \nmay privilege certain actors.\n\nIn contrast to previous studies (Schroeder and Lovell 2012; Hjerpe and Linn\u00e9r 2010; \nHjerpe and Buhr 2014), side-events were less well-utilized by YOUNGO, in spite of \nacknowledgement from youth that they offer significant potential for knowledge exchange, \nnetworking, recognition and issue framing. This study therefore adds further evidence in \nsupport of Hjerpe and Linn\u00e9r\u2019s challenge to the notion that side-events enhance pluralism \nand thus improve procedural legitimacy in the UNFCCC. Schroeder and Lovell\u2019s (2012) \nsuggestion of broadening engagement through virtual conferencing and encouraging co-\nhosting of side-events to bring together diverse actors could support young people to over-\ncome these barriers to their agency.\n\nLack of Material Power also limits the ability of young volunteers to sustain participa-\ntion over time. This makes it difficult to develop relationships with negotiators, meaning \nthat the \u2018insider status\u2019 enjoyed by other NSAs (Betsill and Corell 2008) is more difficult \nto attain. This puts less-established NSAs at a disadvantage, particularly when observer \naccess is heavily restricted, as seems to reoccur at critical moments such as the Kyoto Pro-\ntocol negotiations (ibid); COP 15 (Schroeder and Lovell 2012) and COP 21 (L\u00f6vbrand \net\u00a0al. 2017).\n\nFindings also support Albin (1999), by demonstrating that in spite of having equal \naccess to the intergovernmental space, powerful groups remain dominant, as seen in \nYOUNGO\u2019s relationship with ENGO. Although collaboration could increase their Mate-\nrial and Social Powers, YOUNGO and other small constituencies should remain mindful \nof their own objectives and preferred strategies to ensure that their Cognitive Power is not \noverlooked when working with other NSAs.\n\nIn answer to Michele Betsill\u2019s (2008) call for further research into whether the nature \nof an issue has implications for NSA agency, this paper provides empirical evidence that \ncertain issues are more open to NSA agency such as Article 6 where youth are deemed to \nhave relevant expertise. However, results show that recognition is constrained by the silos \nin which policies are negotiated. This contributes a more nuanced understanding of Nasiri-\ntousi et\u00a0al\u2019s (2016) identification of the Governance Profiles attributed to each UNFCCC \nconstituency,\u00a0raising important considerations for procedural legitimacy\u00a0and justice.\n\n6  Conclusion\n\nThis paper sheds light upon YOUNGO as a previously un-researched TAN and provides \ninsight into the structure and\u00a0agency of this constituency. It tests and develops the power \nsource concept (Nasiritousi et\u00a0al. 2016) and finds that while NSA transitions from actor \nto agent depend upon recognition of their governance profiles, this is also shaped by the \nstrategies which NSAs employ. It also finds that agency is often limited to the policy silos \nin which recognition is negotiated rather than spanning all aspects of global environmental \ngovernance as previously assumed.\n\nBy cooperating as a TAN, youth have gained recognition from the UNFCCC Secre-\ntariat in the form of constituency status, based largely on their Representative Power. How-\never, within the intergovernmental process, it is their Social and Cognitive Powers which \nappear to be most successful in securing recognition. These appear to be best wielded with \nconstructive, targeted strategies which focus on building relationships with individual \ndecision-makers and offering concrete, policy-relevant and politically feasible solutions. \n\n\n\n387Youth participation and\u00a0agency in\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations Framework\u2026\n\n1 3\n\nHowever, this is particularly difficult for YOUNGO on account of their lack of Material \nPower which hinders their ability to sustain participation and to develop relationships over \nthe longer-term. In the hubbub of UNFCCC negotiations, where\u00a0decision-makers have lim-\nited time and capacity they are unlikely to attend youth events or to seek out their advo-\ncacy messages\u00a0unless they already perceive them to be valuable contributors. This paper \nhas demonstrated that the participatory experiences which young people undergo in the \nUNFCCC shape and are shaped by their perceptions of the process and their agency within \nit. When young people believe that their input is welcome they are encouraged to engage \nin a way which aligns with procedural norms and is resultantly well-received. However, \nwhen their participatory experiences are negative, youth attribute this to lack of recogni-\ntion rather than to structural barriers or to their lack of a particular Power Source. This \nfosters a perception of marginalization, catalyzing a chain of more combative participatory \nactivities. It therefore becomes apparent that if the UNFCCC wishes for youth to remain \nengaged in the UNFCCC as constructive rather than disruptive actors, they should invest in \nensuring that the early experiences of new participants are positive ones, and that participa-\ntory arrangements take account of the differentiated abilities of NSAs to utilize them, pay-\ning particular attention to those endowed with less Material Power.\n\nAs global environmental change looms large, NSA involvement is considered ever more \nimportant in creating legitimacy for environmental policy and supporting implementation, \nas emphasized in the Paris Agreement. It is therefore pertinent to assess whether the modes \nof NSA participation facilitated within intergovernmental processes actually foster agency, \nfor whom, and under which circumstances. It is also necessary to determine the Govern-\nance Profiles of different NSA groups to ensure that limited resources are strategically \ndeployed. Further research should assess the extent to which these findings are applicable \nto other policy fora, with specific focus on the youth who will inherit these governance \nchallenges and whose agency is therefore critical to the longevity of environmental policy. \nAs one interviewee expressed:\n\nAs the youth population is growing worldwide, those Parties who involve youth \nupfront will have a head start.39\n\nAcknowledgements An enormous thank you to Stavros Afionis for your unfailingly enthusiastic and \ninvaluable support and to Lucie Middlemiss and Philippa Roddis for bringing fresh insights to this paper.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards \n\nConflict of interest The author declares that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Inter-\nnational License (http://creat iveco mmons .org/licen ses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, \nand reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the \nsource, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\n\n39 Interview C1.\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\n388 H.\u00a0Thew \n\n1 3\n\nReferences\n\nAlbin, C.
