Social networking platforms and video-sharing sites like YouTube generate hopes for\na more participatory politics and stronger connections between citizens and representatives, particu-\nlarly at the local level. This article examines these trajectories by analyzing the YouTube presence of\ncandidates in municipal election campaigns, as well as public involvement in these campaigns.\n\nKEYWORDS. Campaigning, Internet, political communication, social media, user-generated\ncontent, video, Web 2.0, YouTube\n\nCAMPAIGNING ONLINE\n\nThis article is one piece in a series of stud-\nies by the author that analyze Internet usage in\npolitical campaigns, emphasizing the municipal\nlevel (Lev-On, 2011, forthcoming). The arti-\ncle analyzes the use of the video-sharing site\nYouTube by candidates running for heads of\nmunicipalities during the campaigns for elec-\ntions held in November 2008.\n\nThe extensive penetration of the Internet and\nits significant political applications make Israel\na promising research arena of online campaign-\ning. The penetration rates of the Internet in Israel\nare high, and its general and political uses are\nprevalent. According to the semi-annual TIM\nsurvey, which measures exposure to the Internet\nand online usage patterns (June 2008), it is used\n\nAzi Lev-On is the chair of the School of Communication in Ariel University Center in Israel, and the\nhead of the Center for the Study of Internet, Politics and Society. Dr. Lev-On\u2019s studies explore behaviors and\ncollective action in computer-mediated environments, employing a variety of methods such as link analysis,\nsurveys, and laboratory experiments. Recent research analyzes how and why computer-mediated communica-\ntion impacts monetary transfers and trust, how people rank news stories online, Internet usage by candidates\nin municipal elections, and by ultra-orthodox women who participate in closed forums online.

Social media sites,\nincluding YouTube and Facebook, enjoy mas-\nsive exposure. According to another TIM survey\nfrom October 2008, YouTube exposure rates\nwere 39.7%, which ranks it as the fourth most\nexposed site (right after Google and the leading\nIsrael news portals Walla! and Ynet). Facebook\nwas rated sixth with exposure rates of 29%\n(Cohen, 2008).\n\nIt is appropriate to study Israel when exam-\nining trends in online campaigning due to the\nextensive use of the Internet in Israeli national\npolitical campaigns. The recognition of the\ngrowing importance of the Internet as a medium\n\n205\n\n\n\n206 JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n\nfor political marketing is accompanied by the\nwillingness to invest resources in parties\u2019 and\ncandidates\u2019 online presence. In the general elec-\ntions of 2009, almost all political parties used\nWeb sites, and many were present on a vari-\nety of Internet platforms. However, there is still\na feeling of reluctance to involve the public in\ncampaigning, and sites most often function as\n\u201cbulletin boards,\u201d transmitting information from\nparties to the public without many possibilities\nfor engagement. Audiences visit parties\u2019 Web\nsites in small numbers (Caspi & Lev, 2009;\nLev-On, 2011).\n\nStudying the political usage of the Internet\nis especially interesting at the municipal level.\nMunicipalities handle many issues that are of\ndirect relevance to citizens\u2019 everyday lives (e.g.,\neducation, welfare, local infrastructure), and it\nis much more feasible (compared to national-\nlevel politics) to use the Internet in order to reach\nout to relevant population segments, consult\nthem, and weigh-in their priorities in munici-\npal decision-making processes. The campaign-\ning season is a particularly good time to use\nthe Internet in order to communicate with local\nconstituencies. Local elections involve a signifi-\ncantly smaller number of voters than the general\nelections. Hence, the likelihood that they are\ndecided on the basis of a small number of votes\nsignificantly increases. In such elections, it is\nlikely that candidates use every tool at their\ndisposal to get voters to the polls.\n\nHowever, some variables related to the can-\ndidate, the characteristics of the political races,\nand the electorate may reduce the probabilities\nof Internet use in local campaigns. The lack of\nawareness of the benefits of Internet use as a\npolitical tool or hesitation from interaction with\nthe public may lead candidates to prefer tra-\nditional forms of marketing. Some candidates\nmay feel that they are sufficiently known to the\npublic and that they are guaranteed success at\nthe ballot box without opening a new market-\ning channel online (Herrnson, 2004; Kamarck,\n2003; Lev-On, 2011; Strachan, 2003). Lack of\nInternet usage in an area or a specific sector\nmay also negatively impact candidates\u2019 deci-\nsions about establishing online campaign pres-\nence (Herrnson, Stokes-Brown, & Hindman,\n2007; Lev-On, 2011, forthcoming).\n\nIn Israel, voting in municipal elections is\ncarried out under a two-ballot system: one for\na candidate who competes for the head of\nthe authority, the other for a party that runs\nfor the municipal assembly. If only one con-\ntender submits his candidacy, he or she is\ndeclared the winner without an election. If no\ncandidates reach 40% of the vote, a second\nround is held two weeks after the first round.\nThe study discussed in this article looks at\nsocial media usage by candidates for heads of\nmunicipalities.\n\nIt seems that in the 2008 municipal elections,\nthe Internet, YouTube included, aroused great\ninterest, at least in major cities such as Tel Aviv-\nYafo. For instance, journalist Gal Mor wrote on\nYnet that \u201cthe Internet awakened the campaign\nin Tel Aviv. Heated discussions on blogs and\ntalkbacks, videos on YouTube and Facebook,\nGoogle bombs and whatnot . . .,\u201d mainly due\nto the extensive use of the Internet by the cam-\npaign teams of contender for Mayor Dov Hanin\nand of his opponent Ron Huldai, the re-elected\nmayor (Mor, 2008). This study examines if and\nhow YouTube was used, and if it facilitated\ncitizen involvement and participation in local\ncampaigns.\n\nHow do parties and candidates use the online\ntools at their disposal? With the rise of online\ncampaign activity as well as the research on\nthe subject, two main approaches concerning\nthe differences between online and \u201ctraditional\u201d\npolitical campaigning can be identified. Since\nthe pioneering study of Margolis and Resnick\n(2000), numerous studies have supported their\nclaim that despite the promises of new media,\nit brings \u201cmore of the same,\u201d or as they put\nit, reproduces patterns of \u201cpolitics as usual.\u201d\nIndeed, studies have demonstrated that, with\nvery few exceptions, the online campaign expe-\nrience quite resembles the experience of tra-\nditional campaigning, and the vast majority of\nparty or candidate campaign sites are character-\nized by top-down communication and very little\ninteraction. Sites tend to be active mostly during\nthe campaign season, and are otherwise \u201cdor-\nmant\u201d or even do not exist. Moreover, it appears\nthat the parties do not shift a significant portion\nof their activities to the Internet, and the goal of\ntheir online activity is often to create an image of\n\n\n\nLev-On 207\n\nup-to-dateness and professionalism (for a recent\nsurvey see Gibson & Ward, 2009).\n\nHowever, with the rapid penetration of the\nInternet to many new layers of the popula-\ntion and the growth of the online \u201ctool belt\u201d\navailable to campaigners, scholars have updated\nthe \u201cnormalization\u201d theory, claiming that indeed\nthe Internet can update the patterns of political\nmedia campaigns, depending upon the envi-\nronment of the relevant campaigns (Foot &\nSchneider, 2006; Xenos & Foot, 2005). It seems\nthat the Internet usage in Obama\u2019s success-\nful U.S. presidential campaign may be a land-\nmark outlining this trend (for recent accounts\nsee Pew Internet and American Life Project,\n2009; Stallings-Carpenter, 2010; for accounts\nof the \u201cAmericanization\u201d of Israeli political\ncampaigns, see Caspi & Lev, 2009, and more\ngenerally, Aronoff, 2000).\n\nGibson and Ward (2009) summarize the aca-\ndemic literature on online campaigns and argue\nthat they tend to be characterized along several\nlines. Parties often do not want to \u201ctake risks\u201d\nwhen it comes to their activity online. Therefore,\nthey use their Web site mainly for information\ndistribution, and secondarily make use of mate-\nrials produced for the offline campaign. As such,\nthey make a minimal and well-monitored use of\ninteractive tools (see also Ward, Owen, Davis,\n& Taras, 2008). However, there is an awak-\nening of Internet usage to reach out to dif-\nferent audiences, using a variety of platforms\nto tailor-deliver different messages to different\nconstituencies. The Internet is also increasingly\nused for recruiting volunteers, members, and\nresources.\n\nYOUTUBE AS A POLITICAL\nCAMPAIGNING ARENA\n\nWhy focus scholarly attention on political\ncampaigning on YouTube? After looking at the\nfollowing numbers, the answer to this ques-\ntion may seem fairly straightforward. Each con-\ntender to the U.S. presidential primaries in\n2008 established a channel on YouTube, and\nseven candidates even announced their candi-\ndacy for the first time through this media chan-\nnel (Grove, 2008; Gulati & Williams, 2010).\n\nTheir campaign crews uploaded thousands of\nvideos, which were viewed by tens of mil-\nlions of users. In 2008 alone, YouTube users\nspent no less than 14.5 billion hours watch-\ning official videos of the Barack Obama cam-\npaign (see Gulati & Williams, 2010), and in\ntotal, no less than 35% of Americans watched\nonline political videos that year (Smith &\nRainie, 2008). Special attention was drawn to\na limited number of homemade videos includ-\ning \u201cObama Girl,\u201d which received millions of\nviews,1 and to new inclusive online formats,\nsuch as the debates organized collaboratively\nbetween YouTube and CNN. A study by the\nCenter for Communication & Civic Engagement\ncalled this election \u201cthe first YouTube elec-\ntion\u201d (Center for Communication and Civic\nEngagement, 2009).\n\nEven after the elections, the White House\nYouTube channel has been updated frequently\nwith weekly presidential addresses, including\nconducting a virtual \u201ctown meeting\u201d in which\nviewers uploaded videos with questions and the\npresident answered some of the most popular\nones (Sutter, 2009).\n\nThe vast use of YouTube during and after the\ncampaigns makes it a fascinating and impor-\ntant arena for examining the political uses of\nnew technologies (Gueorguieva, 2008). Indeed,\na special issue of the Journal of Information\nTechnology & Politics was recently devoted to\nthe political uses of YouTube.\n\nYouTube offers several significant benefits\nfor politicians and their campaign staff. The\nsite enables them to upload a practically unlim-\nited amount of filmed materials at no cost,\nand without third-party mediation. Uploading\nvideos is easy, fast, and can be done instantly\nin near-real time. Due to the enormous pop-\nularity of the site, its use may dramatically\nincrease the exposure of the candidate to the rel-\nevant audiences, particularly to young voters.2\n\nAt the time of writing, videos on YouTube\ninterface well with search results in Google\u2019s\nsearch engine (Google owns YouTube), which\nmay further contribute to high rates of expo-\nsure (Gueorguieva, 2008; Gulati & Williams,\n2010; Klotz, 2010). All these benefits make\nYouTube both an important marketing channel\nand a significant study arena.\n\n\n\n208 JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n\nAlongside the significant advantages of\nYouTube as a campaigning channel, it is also\nimportant to recognize the challenges it intro-\nduces to campaigners. First and foremost, it is\na collaborative site that is open to everyone, and\nanyone can open a channel and upload materials.\nAs a result, the tight control of campaigners over\nthe campaigns\u2019 messages may loosen. While\neach fan or supporter can upload a video, rate\nit, or comment on it, these opportunities are\nopen to opponents as well, opening the door to\nsabotage of a painstakingly orchestrated cam-\npaign. In order to properly utilize this platform,\nmanpower may be needed not only to upload\nthe right materials at the right time, but also to\nmonitor audience reaction and promptly respond\n(Gueorguieva, 2008).\n\nA small number of studies have examined\nthe uses of YouTube in U.S. political cam-\npaigns. A study that examined YouTube usage\non 2008 Senate elections found that 44% of\nthe popular videos were short campaign ads\n(up to 30 seconds) prepared originally for TV.\nOnly a small percentage of the popular cam-\npaign videos was created by citizens, while\nthe great majority was created by professional\nteams (Klotz, 2010). The author concludes that\nthe 2008 campaigns introduced greater political\nusage of YouTube than the 2006 campaigns and\nalso attracted more viewership. Still, accord-\ning to the author, \u201cThe 2008 Senate campaign\non YouTube provides little evidence to sup-\nport the theory that democratized video edit-\ning, production, and distribution motivates new\nformats and producers of political communi-\ncation. Rather, YouTube has broadened access\nto repurposed communication from campaign\nparticipants\u201d (Klotz, 2010, p. 121).\n\nA similar conclusion is reached by Gulati\nand Williams (2010), who analyzed the usage of\nYouTube in the campaigns for the U.S. Senate\nand the House of Representatives in 2008.\nAlthough most candidates opened YouTube\nchannels, the popular clips were mostly pro-\nfessionally produced for TV. Candidates with\nstrong financial backing were more likely to\nopen a channel on YouTube and upload more\nclips. Competitive races increased the probabil-\nities of having a YouTube channel. Incumbents\nhave posted more videos than new candidates,\n\nin many cases because their past public work\nwas documented and later used in the campaign\n(Gulati & Williams, 2010).\n\nIn Israel, the venue of the current study, Caspi\nand Lev (2009) were the first to study YouTube\nusage in the general elections campaigns. The\nauthors found that 22 of the 33 parties that com-\npeted for the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) had a\nchannel on YouTube. Parties have uploaded a\ntotal of nearly one thousand videos, an average\nof 47.1 videos per party, viewed approximately\n120,000 times, or about 120 views per video.\nThe numbers of subscribers to parties\u2019 channels\nwere in the double digits, except for the channels\nof the two big parties, Likud (257) and Kadima\n(151). The authors argue that there is an \u201cimple-\nmentation gap\u201d of new media between parties\nthat rush to adopt them for campaigning, and the\npublic that makes little use of them.\n\nFollowing up on the acceptance of new media\namong different constituencies, a relevant aspect\nfor the current research is the gap between can-\ndidates competing for head of municipalities\nin the Jewish sector and in the Arab sector.\nAccording to Kaminski and Bar-Tal (1996), the\nrelations between Jews and Arabs in Israel, in\nthe pre- as well as the post-state periods (after\n1948), are best captured by the label \u201csepara-\ntion,\u201d which is manifest (among other things) in\nthe near-complete geographic self-segregation\nof members of both groups. The separation\nto geographically distinct municipal authorities\nenables a comparison of Internet usage in polit-\nical campaigns by candidates running for heads\nof authorities with Jewish and Arab populations.\n\nNote that some factors could have, in fact,\nencouraged a significant usage of the Internet\nin the Arab-Palestinian sector in the municipal\ncampaigns, over and above its potential usage\nin the Jewish sector. The number of candidates\nper municipality was slightly higher in the non-\nJewish municipalities vs. Jewish municipalities\n(4 vs. 3.7 on average), i.e., increased competi-\ntion. Also, the municipal elections in the non-\nJewish sector are characterized by significantly\nhigher voting rates than that of the Jewish sector\n(Mustafa, 2005), i.e., heightened public inter-\nest. In the current elections, turnout rates were\n83.5% in the Arab population vs. 45.8% among\nthe Jewish population.\n\n\n\nLev-On 209\n\nBut in spite of that, comparing Internet usage\namong candidates competing in Jewish and\nArab municipalities shows a deep usage divide.\nAmong the 213 candidates competing in the\nnon-Jewish municipalities, only eight candi-\ndates, less than five percent, had a Web site,\ncompared to 191 (50.1%) of the Jewish can-\ndidates. YouTube usage was similarly negligi-\nble. The absence of Internet use in the Arab-\nPalestinian sector is an interesting phenomenon\nthat cannot be explained by access differences\nalone. This phenomenon requires a separate\nexplanation, which may take into account vari-\nables such as the unique social structure in the\nArab-Palestinian sector in Israel as well negative\npersonal attitudes towards technology (see Lev-\nOn, forthcoming). Thus, the rest of the analysis\nin this article refers to municipal races in author-\nities with Jewish populations, where Internet\nand, in particular, YouTube usage were much\nmore evident.\n\nThis study is the first to examine YouTube\nusage at the municipal level. The elections that\nare held throughout the country in numerous\nmunicipalities enable us to examine and analyze\nWeb campaigning at a \u201chigher\u201d resolution than\nby studying campaigns for the general elections,\nwhich take place in Israel in a single district (the\nentire country). Studying municipal campaigns\nalso enables researchers to get a full picture\nof YouTube political usage, which results from\na large number of \u201cmicro-decisions\u201d by many\ncandidates, not just a small number of decisions\ntaken by the large parties\u2019 image consultants.\nAs a result, researchers may discern differences\nin the geographic, socio-economic, and cultural\nlandscapes that affect candidates\u2019 decisions to\nuse the Internet.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS AND\nHYPOTHESES\n\nThe study focuses on three main research\nareas:\n\nA. The extent of YouTube usage by candi-\ndates\n\nB. The difference in YouTube usage accord-\ning to strategic variables (associated with\n\nparticular races) and socio-demographic\nvariables of the population\n\nC. Audience involvement in YouTube munic-\nipal campaigning\n\nMy hypotheses are as follows:\n\n\u2022 H1: Candidates will make significant use\nof YouTube. This hypothesis is based on\nthe 50% usage of Web sites in munici-\npal elections in a related study (Lev-On,\n2011). YouTube is particularly valuable in\nmunicipal elections, where contestants typ-\nically have meager resources. Due to the\nlow costs of production and distribution\nof materials, YouTube could be an excel-\nlent campaigning platform at the municipal\nlevel.\n\n\u2022 H2: Incumbents running for re-election\nwill make use of YouTube significantly\nless than non-incumbents. This hypothe-\nsis is based on the fact that incumbents\nmay be already familiar to the public, as\ntheir details and portrait appear on munic-\nipal publications, billboards, the municipal\nWeb site, and more. In contrast, newcom-\ners are likely to be less known, and there-\nfore will make greater use of YouTube\nto reach potential voters (for findings in\nthis vein see Herrnson, 2004; Herrnson\net al., 2007; Kamarck, 2003, especially\npp. 87\u201388; Lev-On, 2011).3\n\n\u2022 H3: The more competitive the elections,\nthe more candidates make use of YouTube.\nThis hypothesis is based upon the assump-\ntion that the more competitive the elections\nare, the more extensively YouTube will be\nused due to the greater the incentives to use\nevery tool at contenders\u2019 disposal to garner\nvoters to the polls (see Gulati & Williams,\n2010; Herrnson, 2004; Herrnson et al.,\n2007; Kamarck, 2003; Lev-On, 2011).\n\n\u2022 H4: The higher the number of eligible\nvoters, the greater the usage of YouTube\nwill be by contenders. The hypothesis is\nbased on the assumption that as the vot-\ning population grows, more effort would\nbe required to reach eligible voters, and\nin addition to more traditional methods,\n\n\n\n210 JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n\ngreater use would be made of YouTube\nand other Internet tools to reach out to\nconstituencies (Lev-On, 2011).\n\n\u2022 H5: YouTube will be used more in author-\nities with a young population, popula-\ntions with high income and education, and\nauthorities located in the center of Israel,\ncompared to peripheral authorities, and\nauthorities with older, less affluent, and\nless educated populations. This hypoth-\nesis is based on studies that show that\neducation and income are positively corre-\nlated with Internet access and usage, age\nis negatively correlated, and residents of\nmunicipalities in central geographic loca-\ntions are more connected to the Internet\nthan residents of peripheral municipalities\n(Lev-On & Lissitsa, 2010; Mizrahi, Bar,\nHezronov, & Oron, 2005). These envi-\nronmental characteristics may also impact\ncandidates\u2019 decisions to upload videos to\nYouTube.\n\n\u2022 H6: YouTube audience involvement will be\nnegligible. This hypothesis is based on the\nlow involvement of the audience found in\nstudies of Web site and social media usage\nin the general elections in Israel (Caspi &\nLev, 2009). It is hypothesized that audience\ninvolvement in low-level elections will be\nconsistent with its involvement patterns in\nthe general elections. Still, as this is the\nfirst study to analyze YouTube usage in\nmunicipal campaigns, there are no further\nstudies to support this trajectory.\n\nMETHOD\n\nImmediately after receiving the names of\ncandidates from the national supervisor of elec-\ntions at the Ministry of Interior Affairs, searches\nfor candidates\u2019 YouTube videos were con-\nducted numerous times during the campaigns.\nSearches were conducted and taken from the\nfirst 500 results of Google (using multiple vari-\nations of candidates\u2019 names; for example, \u201cDov\nHanin,\u201d \u201cHanin Dov,\u201d \u201cHanin Tel-Aviv,\u201d and the\nlike, for the candidate Dov Hanin who competed\nin Tel-Aviv). In addition, searches were made\non YouTube\u2019s internal search engine, and when\n\nlocating campaign videos, the channels that\nuploaded them were inspected in order to learn\nif there were additional campaigning materials.\nWe also looked to related videos that YouTube\nsuggested for further viewing. These searches\nwere made in parallel by four research assis-\ntants. References to YouTube materials were\nalso sought on contenders\u2019 Web sites, which\nwere analyzed in a parallel study (Lev-On,\n2011).\n\nFor the purposes of this study, only videos\nthat were uploaded as a part of an organized\ncampaigning effort were included in the anal-\nysis. Clips of incumbent mayors\u2019 actions unre-\nlated to the campaign (for example, visits to\nlocal hospitals and schools), past media appear-\nances of contestants (obvious cases were videos\nthat were uploaded long before the campaign\nstarted), and interviews with candidates in local\nnews sites and debates between them sponsored\nby local organizations and uploaded to YouTube\nwere all excluded from the analysis. To be\nexcluded from the analysis, agreement between\nall four research assistants needed to be reached.\n\nTo study audience involvement, the following\nparameters were examined: the number of views\na YouTube clip received, the number of rates,\nand the number of comments.\n\nBeyond checking the presence or absence of a\nchannel on YouTube and the number of videos,\nthis study analyzes which variables may predict\ncandidates\u2019 YouTube presence. Thus, data were\ngathered about the authorities in which elections\ntook place: how peripheral they were; the num-\nber of eligible voters; and the socio-economic\nstatus, the age distribution, the education, and\nthe income of the population.\n\nIn terms of the electoral competition, it was\nchecked whether the candidate is an incumbent,\nand if not, if the candidate was running against\nan incumbent or a newcomer (where the current\nhead was not running for re-election and the seat\nwas open). Additional measures included the\nnumber of candidates and the degree of compet-\nitiveness of the elections, where the percentage\nof the votes was gained by the winner, and the\ngap between him and the runner-up, were used\nas proxies.4\n\nThe study also used telephone interviews\nwith candidates or their contact persons, since\n\n\n\nLev-On 211\n\nsometimes videos could not be located as they\nwere not promoted well, or at all, in search\nengines, and interviews may have been the only\nway to learn about them. Phone calls were made\nshortly after the elections, when the details were\nstill fresh in the interviewees\u2019 memory; no calls\nwere made prior to the election, in order not to\naffect candidates\u2019 decisions for opening a chan-\nnel on YouTube or uploading videos. Interviews\nwere conducted with 217 of the 381 candidates\n(57%) or their contact persons. The interviews\ndid not ask about the content of the videos, and\nwere made only to double-check; the interviews\nwere made in addition to the searches conducted\nthrough Google, YouTube, and candidates\u2019 cam-\npaign sites, and their place in the research design\nwas secondary.\n\nFINDINGS\n\nGeneral Data\n\nThe municipal elections that took place in\nNovember 2008 were held at 156 municipalities.\nThis study analyzes YouTube usage in the\n103 elections that took place in the Jewish\nauthorities, involving 381 candidates. Of the\n381 candidates (3.7 candidates per munici-\npality), 90 were incumbents, 243 were new\ncandidates who competed against incumbents,\nand 48 were new candidates who competed at\n13 localities where the incumbent candidate did\nnot run for re-election. Municipalities included\nin the analysis below have about 4.3 million eli-\ngible voters, and the percentage of valid votes\nout of the total number of eligible voters was\n1.97 million (45.8%).\n\nOf the 90 incumbents, 72 (80%) were re-\nelected. A second round of elections was held\nat 13 authorities. The average percentage of\nvotes received by candidates was as follows:\nincumbents \u2013 53.2%, new candidates who com-\npeted against incumbents \u2013 17.3%, new candi-\ndates who competed in open-seat races \u2013 27.1%.\n\nOf the 381 contenders, 63 (16.5%) uploaded\nYouTube videos. A total of 226 campaign videos\nwere located\u2014an average of 3.59 per candi-\ndate. Note (Figure 1) that the distribution of\ncampaign videos among candidates is highly\nunequal; the three candidates with the highest\nYouTube presence uploaded 70 videos, and the\ntop 14 candidates (22.2%) uploaded 148 videos\n(65.5% of the videos) combined.\n\nThe relatively low presence of candidates\non YouTube clips refutes the first hypothe-\nsis (H1). Note that candidates who had no\nYouTube clips received 26.8% of the vote in\ntheir municipalities, while candidates who had\nsome YouTube presence received 28% of the\nvote. However, these differences were not sig-\nnificant. Note also that 84% of candidates who\nwere on YouTube also had a Web site, while\nonly 43% who had no YouTube presence had a\nsite, so the presence in various Internet spaces\nseems to be related.\n\nNext, YouTube usage was compared between\nincumbents (15.6% of whom uploaded videos),\ncontenders competing against incumbents\n(16%), and new candidates competing in open-\nseat races (20.8%). However, the differences\nare not statistically significant. Therefore the\nsecond hypothesis (H2) about differential usage\nof YouTube by incumbents and new contenders\nis also rejected.\n\nFIGURE 1.

Table 1 compares\nthe mean values of strategic variables across\ncandidates with and without YouTube presence.\n\nThe differences between the strategic vari-\nables were significant, but generally small, with\nthe exception of the number of eligible voters.\nCandidates with videos competed in authorities\nwith more eligible voters, (marginally) more\ncandidates, and greater competitiveness (lower\npercentage of votes of winning, a smaller\ngap between the winner and runner-up) than\n\ncandidates with no videos. These results lend a\nqualified support for hypotheses H3 and H4.\n\nThe Impact of Socio-Economic Factors on\nYouTube Usage\n\nNext, candidates with and without Web sites\nwere compared on a cross-section of a num-\nber of socio-economic variables. According to\nTable 2, candidates with a YouTube presence\ntypically run in municipalities where the per-\ncentage of residents ages 20\u201329 is slightly lower\n(in contrast to the corresponding hypothesis,\nH5; for similar findings regarding Web site\nusage, see Lev-On, 2011), and percentage of\nresidents in ages 30\u201344 is slightly higher, than\nthe municipalities where candidates without a\nYouTube presence compete. In addition, candi-\ndates with a YouTube presence come from the\nauthorities that are less peripheral, with higher\n\nTABLE 1.

These findings provide limited\nsupport to the relevant hypothesis (H5). Still,\nnote that not in all the criteria that were com-\npared were there significant differences between\ncandidates with and without a YouTube pres-\nence. Note also that the differences, even when\nsignificant, are quite weak.\n\nPublic Involvement in YouTube Campaign\nVideos\n\nLast, public involvement in the campaigns\nwas measured. The average views per campaign\nvideo were rather slim, approximately 350 until\nElection Day. One video stood out: Called \u201cIt\u2019s\nNot My city,\u201d5 this was a video by celebrities\nwho supported Dov Hanin, the opposition can-\ndidate in Tel Aviv, that protested the lack of\nparking and the building of high-rise buildings\nall over the city (Hanin was also the candidate\nwith the largest number of video clips, 39, with\nmost uploaded by his supporters). Until Election\nDay, this clip was watched about 16,000 times.\nNote that if this video is excluded from analysis,\nthan the average number of views per video until\nthe election goes down to around 250. The vast\nmajority of clip views were in the low three-digit\nnumber of hits (between 100\u2013300), and some\nwere even in the double-digit zone.\n\nOut of the 226 videos that were located,\n130 were rated, and the average number of rat-\nings per clip was 3.7. Only 75 videos were\ncommented on; the average number of com-\nments per clip was 2.5. It seems that, as a whole,\nthese findings support H6, and demonstrate a\nlow involvement of the public in the YouTube\nactivities of candidates.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWith the extensive penetration and use of the\nInternet as a political and marketing tool, it is\nimportant to explore and document its use not\nonly in national politics, but at the municipal\nlevel as well. Both the dynamics and granular-\nity of decision-making in the municipal context\n\npresents an opportunity for new insights into the\nuse of online media such as YouTube in political\ncampaigning. The study\u2019s narrow scope illumi-\nnates a scholarship area that has not been fully\nexamined up until this point.\n\nThis article focuses on YouTube\u2014one plat-\nform for online campaigning that is unique for\nits visibility and rich video experience, among\nother things. While there are hopes that YouTube\nand similar platforms will change the dynamics\nof campaigning, reach audiences, and involve\nthem, data from its actual usage by candidates\nand audiences at the municipal level suggest oth-\nerwise and, at least for now, bring some fresh\nskepticism on the ability to use YouTube as a\nplatform for a more participatory and interactive\nlocal politics.\n\nThe municipal arena is an intriguing envi-\nronment in which to study online campaigning.\nLocal campaigns are not affluent with resources,\nthey address a relatively small number of vot-\ners concentrated in a relatively small geographic\narea, and only thousands or tens of thousands of\npeople can vote per municipality. Due to the low\nnumber of voters, there might well be a situation\nwhere the margin between victory and defeat is\nslim\u2014a situation where any tool through which\nvoters can be reached and influenced may be\nvaluable. While door-to-door canvassing tech-\nniques as well as parlor meetings are still impor-\ntant in such settings, the Internet can be very\nuseful as well, and campaigning through Web\nsites, social media platforms, and in particular\nYouTube may very well be the differentiating\nfactor between success or defeat at the polls.\n\nThe article examines the actual scope and\ncharacter of YouTube usage in municipal cam-\npaigns, and socio-economic and strategic vari-\nables that may predict YouTube usage, as well\nas audience involvement. The main findings sig-\nnify that candidates are not investing significant\neffort in YouTube as a campaign channel, and\nthat there appears to be little audience involve-\nment. Only one-sixth of the contestants in the\nJewish sector established sites, and only a slim\nnumber of the candidates uploaded ten videos or\nmore. Public involvement (views, ratings, com-\nments) was rather slim, and it seems that inter-\naction between candidates and constituencies\nthrough YouTube is still a remote vision.\n\n\n\n214 JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS\n\nThis article might be understood to revisit\nthe findings presented by Gulati and Williams\n(2010), in a fresh context and at a different\nscale of political action. The findings support\nthe well-developed academic skepticism of the\nhype of social media in e-participation. It may\nbe the case that, in spite of their touted potential,\nservices such as YouTube nonetheless require\nsignificant resources to be used successfully in\nthe context of a municipal campaign.\n\nSignificant differences were found among\ncandidates with and without a YouTube pres-\nence, in the cross-section of strategic variables.\nCandidates with a presence on YouTube com-\npeted in municipalities with more eligible vot-\ners, more candidates, and more intense compe-\ntition (lower percentage of votes of winning, a\nsmaller gap between the winner and the runner-\nup) than candidates without a YouTube pres-\nence. Significant, but rather weak, differences\nwere also found in the cross-sections among\ncandidates with and without a YouTube pres-\nence, including several socio-demographic vari-\nables, such as peripherality and some criteria of\nage, education, and income of the constituency.\n\nThe picture that emerges from the study is\nconsistent with previous findings about the lack\nof interactivity in political campaign websites,\nMK (Member of the Knesset) parliamentary\nsites (Haleva-Amir, 2011), and Web sites of\nmunicipalities (Purian, 2011). The findings shed\na critical light on the possibilities of interactive\npolitical usage of the Internet, and compre-\nhensive public engagement online. It is during\nelection campaigns that candidates have clear\nincentives, more so than after the elections, not\nonly to send messages to constituencies, but also\nto hear back and possibly to adjust their platform\naccordingly. The fact that this does not occur,\neven when technology allows for it, demon-\nstrates that there is still a long way to go for the\nfull realization of more participatory and bidi-\nrectional democracy through advanced online\nplatforms.\n\nStill, although only a small percentage of\ncandidates uploaded videos, some candidates\nused it quite extensively, albeit somewhat infre-\nquently. While usage is low overall in municipal\nelections, there were individual spikes of heavy\nuse and attention (notably the case of Dov\n\nHanin), which needs to be explained further.\nSome early adopters demonstrate that social\nmedia can be intensely used at the municipal\nlevel as well, albeit in certain circumstances,\nand possibly depending on variables such as\nthe environment of the authority or even the\npersonality of the contender.\n\nFuture studies should compare the findings\nof this study with Internet usage, and particu-\nlarly social media usage in low-visibility polit-\nical campaigns. It will be interesting to see\nif the broad penetration of social media plat-\nforms, such as Facebook (that became much\nmore prominent in the year following the elec-\ntions), will be translated into greater political\nusage by candidates and constituencies, and\nmore interaction between them.\n\nIt will also be useful to integrate current and\nfuture findings into a theory of uses of candi-\ndates and audiences and their gratifications from\nnew media. Such a theory can explain how can-\ndidates perceive the Internet as an arena for\ncampaigning, what the perceived opportunities\nand costs are, what the actual uses of the Internet\n(and of social media in particular) are, and how\ntheir expected impact is perceived.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKsoXH\nYICqU\n\n2. The site was ranked third in Alexa when data for\nthis study were collected. See also Madden (2009), and\nYouTube\u2019s own fact sheet at http://www.youtube.com/t/\nfact_sheet.\n\n3. Gulati and Williams (2010) found that incumbents\nhave uploaded more YouTube videos than new candidates\nin the U.S. senate elections. However, in the elections they\nstudied, unlike the elections studied here, candidates invest\nconsiderable sums of money, and also there are consid-\nerable quantities of filmed materials collected during the\nincumbent\u2019s term in office. Since municipal candidates do\nnot have substantial budgets or massive film archives, we\ndo not expect to see a similar phenomenon here.\n\n4. Data about socio-economic status, age median,\neducation (percentage of students among residents in the\nage group 20\u201329, percentage of high school graduates\namong residents ages 17\u201318), and income (average\nincome, percentage of residents earning minimum wage,\npercentage of residents earning twice or more than\nthe average wage) are based on Israeli CBS (Central\nBureau of Statistics) data published in March 2008 on\n\n\n\nLev-On 215\n\nthe Web site of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, http://\nwww.moin.gov.il/Apps/PubWebSite/publications.nsf/\nAll/5FCD19CFBECFBC18C2257427002FF5DC/FILE/\nPublications.pdf?OpenElement. The district, and the\npercentages of residents ages 20\u201329 and 30\u201344 in the\npopulation, were taken from the CBS Website, http://\nwww1.cbs.gov.il/publications/local_authorities2006/\nexcel/p_libud.xls. Data about how peripheral the authority\nwas were also taken from the CBS Web site, http://\nwww.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2008n/24_08_160b.pdf. The num-\nbers of eligible voters were taken from messages posted by\nthe elections supervisor in the Israeli Ministry of Interior\nAffairs. Details of incumbents were downloaded from the\nWeb site of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, and from the\nsite of the center of the local authorities in Israel, http://\nwww.iula.org.il. Unfortunately, data on other parameters\nthat can be of relevance, such as Internet connectivity rates\nand population religiosity in different locations across the\ncountry, are not available.\n\n5. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAZ0jos3dyg\n6.
