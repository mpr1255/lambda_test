(2012) (Trans. Silver, N.). Mao: Stalin and the Korean War: Trilateral\nCommunist Relations in the 1950s. London: Routledge, xiii + 249 pp.,\n$135, \u00a380.\n\nThis extremely useful book covers both more and less than what it states in\nthe title. More, because Shen Zihua delves back into the 1940s to uncover\nwhat he views as the crucial origins of communist decision making in 1950.\nAnd less, since the book focuses on the bilateral Stalin-Mao relationship, cul-\nminating with their crucial Korean War decisions in the summer and autumn.\nIndeed, although Shen includes some useful insights into how the economic\nrepercussion of the war shaped the Sino\u2013Soviet alliance for the remainder\nof the 1950s, this book belongs firmly with the large literature on why Stalin\ndecided to back North Korea\u2019s invasion of the south in June 1950 and why\nMao decided to intervene in the war in October.\n\nAlongside the existing body of work on these questions, Shen seeks to\nmake a contribution on four levels. First and most specifically, he reassesses\nStalin\u2019s and Mao\u2019s specific motivations. In both instances, he emphasises\neconomic and national-security factors: Stalin\u2019s keenness to acquire access\nto a warm water port in South Korea and Mao\u2019s determination to keep the\nfighting away from Chinese territory. Second, he argues for the need to view\nthese decisions in a longer time frame. In Stalin\u2019s case, the replacement of\nthe Yalta system with the new Sino\u2013Soviet Treaty meant that in early 1950 the\nSoviet leader had effectively given up \u201cmost of the political and economic\nrights and interests that he had wrested from Chiang Kai-shek in 1945\u201d; hence\nhis sudden interest in letting Kim Il Sung invade South Korea, where the\nports of \u201cInchon and Pusan would replace Lushun and Dalian, which he had\npledged to return to China\u201d (p. 118). For Mao, meanwhile, memories of the\nmid-1940s, when Soviet forces had first helped to defeat Japan and had then\nstayed in northeast China, convinced him of the dangers of letting another\nwar come close to his borders; after all, if Soviet troops were now required\nagainst the Americans, they might this time stay for good. Third, Shen devotes\nconsiderable space to the one piece of concrete help Mao wanted from Stalin\nbefore intervening in the Korean War: air cover. He skilfully connects the\ntortuous negotiations between both sides on this question to their central\npolicy priorities: for Stalin, avoiding direct involvement in the fighting; for\n\n531\n\n\n\n532 Book Review\n\nMao, intervening before the war got too close to home. He also points out\nhow, in the short term, these negotiations created major tensions in the\nalliance, but that as the war dragged on and Soviet material support escalated\nthen bilateral relations were strengthened. Fourth, and more generally, these\narguments place Shen firmly in the school of those who focus on security\nrather than ideology. Indeed, although he makes the odd reference to the\nrole of communist ideology, Shen portrays Stalin and Mao as more hard-\nheaded than romantic, more pessimistic than optimistic, even more defensive\nthan offensive. Take Stalin\u2019s mindset in the first half of 1950. Instead of being\ncaught up in the excitement of Mao\u2019s victory in the Chinese civil war, which\nsuggested the correlation of forces was moving firmly in his direction and\nso he could confront the United States in Korea from a position of strength,\nShen argues that the opposite was true. \u201cThe change in the political regime\nin China,\u201d he writes, \u201cand the signing of the new Sino\u2013Soviet treaty made\nStalin wonder if Soviet interests in the Far East were threatened or, possibly,\neven lost\u201d (p. 117).\n\nShen\u2019s conclusions, especially about Stalin\u2019s and Mao\u2019s motivations in\n1950, can certainly be challenged. In fact, Yang Kuisong does just that in\nan elegant and incisive introduction that greatly strengthens this volume.\nAs Yang points out, for instance, there was more to Stalin\u2019s thinking than\ngaining a warm water port. As Chen Jian and Shu Guang Zhang have also\npointed out in other books, there was also more to Mao\u2019s risk-taking than\nprotecting China\u2019s borders. Shen himself alludes to China\u2019s serious economic\nproblems in 1950. These greatly compounded the dangers of going to war\nwith the United States in Korea. Perhaps, therefore, it needed someone with\nsuch a \u201cromantic\u201d concept of warfare, who also saw that fighting the United\nStates could cement the revolution at home, to take such a major gamble.\n\nShen has nevertheless produced a very valuable book. He is particularly\ngood at placing these events in their Sino\u2013Soviet context. His conclusions\nare based on a large number of archival sources, both Russian and Chinese,\nand his copious use of block quotes will be a major attraction for those\nlooking for a good textbook for advanced-level students. Neil Silver has also\nproduced a clear and crisp translation, which makes this a very readable\nbook. I, for one, will certainly be using it for teaching.\n\nSteven Casey\nLondon School of Economics\n\nLondon, UK\n\n\n"}
