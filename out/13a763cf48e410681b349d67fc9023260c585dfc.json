We draw on data from the Continuous \nNational Household Sample Survey (PNAD Continua), \nbetween 2012 and 2017, to estimate both average labor \nmarket indicators over time and proportional hazard \nmodels of unemployment and underemployment. We \nfind that youths\u2019 labor market prospects declined con-\nsiderably over the period, and, as in many countries \nduring economic downturns, young people were more \naffected than adults. The analysis shows that gender, \nrace, and education impact the hazards of unemploy-\nment and underemployment among young Brazilians. \nKaplan-Meier curves show that differences between \nwhite and African Brazilian youth, as well as between \ncollege-educated youth and high school graduates (or \nless), increased between 2016 and 2017, when eco-\nnomic activity was at its worst level.\n\nKeywords: youth; labor market; economic recession; \nproportional hazard models; Brazil\n\nA growing body of research, especially in \ndeveloped economies, has shown that \n\neconomic downturns tend to have a dispropor-\ntional effect on youths\u2019 ability to keep or find \na job, increasing their unemployment and \nunderemployment levels at higher rates than \nthose observed for adult workers (Bell and \nBlanchflower 2011; International Labour \nOrganization [ILO] 2015; Mont\u2019Alvao, \nMortimer, and Johnson 2017).

In this article, we examine how young people \nin Brazil, one of the largest developing countries, have navigated the labor \nmarket over the last few years, paying special attention to the effects of the \nmost recent economic recession between 2014 and 2017.\n\nThe Brazilian labor market experienced major improvements during the first \nfew years of the twenty-first century: consistent gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, declining levels of unemployment and informality, along with rising \nwages, especially for the unskilled workers, leading to a decline in overall inequal-\nity (Kerstenetzky and Machado 2016; Firpo and Pieri 2018). For young workers, \nbetween 2001 and 2012, unemployment levels declined from 14.4 percent to 10.6 \npercent, and underemployment levels declined from 55.5 percent to 39.9 percent, \naccording to data from the National Household Sample Survey (Pesquisa Nacional \npor Amostra Domiciliar or PNAD).1 While these improvements created more \nfavorable conditions for young people to transition to the labor market, including \nfor those without advanced degrees, youth unemployment rates were 15 percent \nin 2012, compared to 6 percent for the whole labor force.\n\nSince the onset of the recession, the GDP contracted approximately 8 percent; \nand overall unemployment rates jumped from 7 percent to historically high levels \nof 14 percent in 2017 (Firpo and Pieri 2018), affecting approximately 14 million \nworkers. While this increasing precariousness in the labor market affected work-\ners of all ages, little attention has been paid to young people\u2019s labor market tra-\njectories during this recessionary period. In this article, we attempt to fill this gap \nby examining trends in labor market prospects for young people in Brazil during \nthe most recent recession. Keeping in mind that labor market trajectories are \ndefined by the interaction between individual characteristics and the local labor \nmarket structure (Sorensen 1974), the next two sections of this article discuss, \nrespectively, how recessionary labor market conditions, and individual character-\nistics, such as skills and demographics, have influenced youths\u2019 labor market \noutcomes. We then discuss the longitudinal structure of our data and how they \ncan contribute to a better understanding of labor market trajectories during eco-\nnomic recessions.\n\nThe Impact of Recessions on Young People\u2019s Labor  \nMarket Outcomes\n\nWhile economic recessions may affect other important indicators of the transi-\ntion to adulthood, such as living arrangements, access to higher education, and \nfamily formation (Crosnoe 2014; Mont\u2019Alvao, Mortimer, and Johnson 2017), \nmost research on the consequences of economic downturns for young people has \nfocused on labor market outcomes.\n\nRecessions affect labor market prospects and outcomes for all workers, but \nyoung people are usually the hardest hit. Young workers are more vulnerable \n\n\n\n40 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nbecause they are still building their human capital and skills set and are more \nlikely to hold temporary jobs in vulnerable industries. Studies have shown that, \non average, their unemployment rates are three times higher than the rates for \nadult workers (ILO 2015), and the disproportional effect of economic downturns \ntends to widen this gap, leading to higher levels of unemployment, underemploy-\nment, informality, and idleness (or NEET; not in education, employment, or \ntraining) for them (Bell and Blanchflower 2011).\n\nThese negative effects of recessions on young people\u2019s socioeconomic out-\ncomes may last even longer than the duration of the recession itself. By increas-\ning their unemployment and underemployment spells, recessions hinder the \nacquisition of work experience and, consequently, the formation of human capi-\ntal, which, in turn, have long-term consequences on employment patterns and \nearnings (Scarpetta, Sonnet, and Manfredi 2010). Studies in the United States, \nJapan, and Canada (Genda, Kondo, and Ohta 2010; Oreopoulos, von Wachter, \nand Heisz 2012), for example, found that youths who either graduated or entered \nthe labor market during recessions had higher unemployment rates and lower \nwages 10 years later.\n\nWhile recessions affect youth in all countries, differences in institutional \narrangements may moderate their effects. The most important institutional \narrangement that can moderate the effect of recessions on youth employment \nprospects is the link between the educational system and the labor market. In \ncountries where the vocational component of education is stronger, such as in \nGermany, Austria, and the Netherlands, these structured links between the edu-\ncational system and the labor market tend to buffer the negative effects of reces-\nsion and lead to better employment prospects than in countries where these links \nare weak (Christopoulou and Ryan 2009; Green and Pensiero 2017).\n\nBrazilian youth usually face a rough transition between school and the world \nof work, especially due to the lack of institutionalized bridges between the edu-\ncational system and the labor market. Their ability to find and secure jobs is \nlimited, leading to higher rates of unemployment and underemployment (infor-\nmality) than for adult workers (Gonzalez 2009; Corseuil et\u00a0al. 2014).\n\nInequalities in Young People\u2019s Outcomes in  \nthe Brazilian Labor Market\n\nThe informal sector has occupied a substantial proportion of the Brazilian and \nLatin American labor forces since at least the 1960s (see Portes and Schauffler \n[1993] for a discussion of competing theories on the emergence of informality in \nthe region), and the careers of many young workers are permanently linked to \nthis sector. Inequalities in educational pathways are important determinants of \nthese trajectories. Cardoso (2016) points out that dropping out of school is a com-\nmon characteristic of many informal self-employed workers in Brazil and that \ntheir careers can be summarized in a series of standardized steps: from school \ndropout to the first precarious job, then to adjustment of occupational \n\n\n\nRECESSION AND YOUTH LABOR MARKET PROSPECTS IN BRAZIL 41\n\nexpectations, then to more precarious jobs, to self-employed. In turn, longer \nspells of underemployment and unemployment, especially for unskilled youths, \nhave led to scarring effects in future wages (Cruces, Ham, and Viollaz 2012) and \nhindered their labor market trajectories in the long term (Corseuil, Franca, and \nPoloponsky 2016).\n\nIn general, unemployment, informality, and participation in the NEET group \n(\u201cnot in education, employment, or training\u201d) have been consistently higher for \nAfrican Brazilians, women, and low-skilled youth (Matijascic and Silva 2016; \nCourseuil and Franca 2016). These inequalities have persisted, even though con-\nsiderable improvements were observed during the first decade of this century, \nwhen the overall quality of the occupations held by young people improved con-\nsiderably, unemployment and underemployment slowed down, and earnings \nincreased for youth from all socioeconomic backgrounds and racial groups \n(Courseuil and Franca 2016). One important factor that contributed to these \nimprovements was the expansion of higher education enrollments, as the propor-\ntion of youth between 18 and 24 years old pursuing college education more than \ndoubled over the last 15 years\u2014from 9 percent in 2001 to almost 20 percent cur-\nrently, according to data from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD).\n\nLittle is known, however, about how economic downturns have impacted \nyouth prospects in the Brazilian labor market, especially regarding the period \nbetween 2014 and 2017, during which a new cycle of economic hardship imposed \nserious obstacles to Brazilian workers. Research in developed economies has \nshown that low-skilled youths are the hardest hit during periods of economic \nhardship (Mills and Blossfeld 2009; Christopoulou and Ryan 2009) and that a \ncollege education has a protective power for both privileged young workers and \nunderprivileged young workers (Curry 2019).\n\nRacial inequalities in youths occupational prospects also intensify during reces-\nsions, as young black workers (Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller 2012), especially young \nblack women (Dozier 2012), face harder conditions to keep or find a job. Findings \nfrom experimental studies (Krosch and Amodio 2014), as well as national sample \nsurveys (Johnston and Lordan 2014), show that during times of economic recession \nthere is an increase in racial bias, which affects the allocation of resources for dif-\nferent racial groups, affecting black workers\u2019 prospects negatively. While studies in \nBrazil, as noted previously, indicate the existence of racial inequalities among \nyoung workers in the labor market, no research has shown whether economic \ncycles can inflate racial bias in the Brazilian labor market. We address this issue by \nrelying in longitudinal data, discussed in the next section, to examine the trajecto-\nries of young workers in Brazil during the most recent recession.\n\nData Source\n\nWe draw upon data from the Continuous National Household Sample Survey \n(PNAD Continua), which collects information on labor market outcomes, as well \nas demographic and educational indicators, from more than two hundred \n\n\n\n42 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nthousand households across the country, every trimester, since 2012. The survey \nis carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and \ncombines a cross-sectional structure with a panel structure. Each household is \ninterviewed once every trimester, for five trimesters, and is, simultaneously, part \nof the cross-sectional sample of the country population for each trimester, as well \nas part of a specific panel.\n\nThis complex structure allows us to estimate both average labor market indica-\ntors over time and statistical models for longitudinal data. We use two analytical \nsamples. To depict trends in unemployment and underemployment indicators, \nour first sample comprises all youth in each trimester, between the first trimester \nof 2012 and third trimester of 2017. For the purposes of this article, we define \nyoung people as those between 18 and 29 years old.2 This group comprises, \napproximately 11 percent of the population during the study period.\n\nThe second sample comprises only a panel of young people in the labor force \ninterviewed by PNAD between the first trimester of 2016 and the first trimester \nof 2017. We chose this panel because economic activity and employment levels \nreached their worst indicators during this period, and we want to understand \nwhether the worsening of the labor market conditions led to increasing inequali-\nties in the hazards of unemployment and underemployment. Our samples com-\nprise approximately 15,400 participants between 18 and 24 years old, and 11,300 \nparticipants between 25 and 29 years old, who were part of the labor force during \nthe period of the study.\n\nMeasures\n\nHere, we describe the variables used in our analyses.\nUnemployment. This is a dichotomous variable coded 0 for those employed \n\nand 1 for those unemployed at each wave of data collection.\n\nUnderemployment. Defined as the lack of formal links (social security, retire-\nment contributions, and other benefits, etc.) between employer and employee, \nthis is also a dichotomous variable coded 0 for those formally employed and 1 for \nthose informally employed at each wave of data collection.\n\nLong-term unemployment. A dichotomous variable (0 = no, 1 = yes) indicat-\ning whether the unemployment spell, at the moment of the interview, was equal \nor more than 12 consecutive months (OECD 2007).\n\nParticipation in the labor force. A dichotomous variable (0 = no, 1 = yes) \nrepresenting workers who are engaged in the labor market, either employed or \nunemployed.\n\nGiving up on job search. This variable (0 = no, 1 = yes) indicates a worker \nwho gave up on looking for jobs after long spells of unemployment.\n\n\n\nRECESSION AND YOUTH LABOR MARKET PROSPECTS IN BRAZIL 43\n\nOccupational status index. We use the International Socio-Economic Index \n(ISEI) of occupational status developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman \n(1992), which ranges from a score of 10 to a score of 90, with higher scores indi-\ncating higher occupational status.\n\nWork hours. The variable indicates the total number of hours worked per \nweek.\n\nGender. This variable is coded as 0 for young men and 1 for young women.\n\nRace. This variable is coded 0 for white youth and 1 for African Brazilian \n(black and brown) youth.\n\nAge. We include binary variables for each age group as a control in our models.\n\nEducation. This is a dichotomous variable coded 0 for youth who achieved \nhigh school or less at the moment of the interview, and 1 for those who are \nenrolled or have graduated from college.\n\nGeographical location. Used mostly as control variables, area is coded 0 for \nnonmetropolitan cities and 1 for metropolitan areas; and region of the country is \na categorical variable coded 1 for north, 2 for northeast, 3 for southeast, 4 for \nsouth, and 5 for midwest.\n\nAnalytical Strategy\n\nWe present two sets of analyses. In the first, we analyze descriptive trends in \nlabor market outcomes for both young workers (18\u201329) and adult workers (30\u2013\n65). Sample sizes for these estimates range from 354,000 observations in the first \ntrimester of 2012 to 364,000 participants in the third trimester of 2017, including \nboth young and adult workers. Although the number of observations has a slight \nincrease during the period, the proportion of young people in the whole popula-\ntion declines from 18.4 percent to 17.2 percent, as an expression of changes in \nthe demographic composition of the Brazilian population. Analyses of this sample \ntake into account expansion weights provided by the IBGE.\n\nIn the second set of analyses, proportional hazards models estimate the effects \nof race, gender, educational background, and geographical context (metropolitan \nareas and regions of the country) on the hazard of unemployment (model 1) and \nunderemployment (model 2) for young workers. This class of models, also known \nas \u201csurvival analysis\u201d or \u201cevent history analysis\u201d (Allison 2014), measures the \nprobability that an event of interest (usually called \u201cfailure\u201d) will occur during the \ntime of the study. These models are widely used in epidemiological studies but \ncan also be applied to a variety of social phenomena (Blossfeld, Hamerle, and \nMayer 1989/2014), including the study of labor market trajectories (see, for \nexample, Flinn and Heckman 1983; Blossfeld and Hamerle 1989). We use a Cox \n\n\n\n44 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nproportional hazards model, a semiparametric model. Our goal is to understand \ninequalities in the hazards of unemployment and underemployment among \nyouth, and this class of models allows us to estimate average effects over time for \neach predictor. We also use Kaplan-Meier estimators to visualize how our predic-\ntors affect labor market trajectories over time. These curves illustrate the cumu-\nlative proportion of young workers who continued (\u201csurvived\u201d) in the labor \nmarket during the period of the study. All models were estimated using the Stata \nstcox and sts graph commands, for the Cox models and the Kaplan-Meier curves, \nrespectively (StataCorp LP 2013).\n\nBecause our dataset has multiple records for each individual (one for each \ntrimester), the error structure is not independent; therefore, we use robust \nstandard errors to account for this issue. Because of the complex nature of the \ndata, many participants do not have information for all five waves of data collec-\ntion, either because they did not participate in all waves or because they were not \nengaged in the labor force at some point of the study. In fact, 36 percent of the \nsample have five records, 14 percent have four records, and 50 percent have \nthree or fewer records.\n\nFindings\n\nDescriptive statistics\n\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the variables used in the survival \nmodels, separately by age group. The means of our dependent variables, unem-\nployment and underemployment, indicate that approximately 42 percent of \nyouth between 18 and 24 years old became unemployed at least once during the \nperiod, and 56 percent held informal jobs. For youth between 25 and 29 years \nold, the means are 26 percent and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nThe gender and racial compositions of the two samples are 46 percent and 47 \npercent of women, and 74 percent and 71 percent of nonwhites, respectively. \nApproximately 25 percent of those between 18 and 24 years old are either \nenrolled or have graduated from college; while among those between 25 and 29 \nyears old, this proportion is 29 percent. More than 30 percent of young people, \nin both age groups, reside in metropolitan areas. Mean ages are 21 and 27, \nrespectively.\n\nTrends in youth labor market outcomes\n\nAs previously discussed, during the first decade of the twenty-first century, \nlabor market prospects improved considerably for young workers in Brazil, when \nunemployment and underemployment rates reached their lowest marks ever, and \ntheir earnings increased substantially (Courseuil and Franca 2016). The reces-\nsion, which started in late 2014, however, led to a reversal in this trend. Figures \n1a through 1d show variations in unemployment, long-term unemployment, \nparticipation in the labor force, and giving up on job search, for youth and adults \n\n\n\nRECESSION AND YOUTH LABOR MARKET PROSPECTS IN BRAZIL 45\n\nbetween the first trimester of 2012 and the third trimester of 2017. Figure 1a \nshows that unemployment rates increased considerably during the recession, \nespecially for young workers between 18 and 24 years of age. While the adult \nrates increased from less than 5 percent in early 2014 (the lowest rate in the \nseries) to almost 10 percent in early 2017, for youth between 18 and 24 years old, \nunemployment rates went from 15 percent to 31 percent in the same period. \nUnemployment for young people between 25 and 29 years old increased from 10 \npercent to 16 percent in 2017.\n\nFigure 1b shows that long-term unemployment has also increased steadily for all \nage groups, and that the three patterns converged at the end of the recession, reach-\ning 45 percent in 2017. That is, while young people have higher unemployment \nrates, long-term unemployment rates have been very similar during the period.\n\nFigure 1c shows that labor market participation has decreased for workers in \nall age groups, but more steeply for those between 18 and 24 years of age. \nApproximately 45 percent of young people in this age group are still in the labor \nforce in 2017, compared to 55 percent in 2012. While the recession may have had \nan impact on labor force participation, it is important to take into account that \nthere is a long-term trend leading to persistent declines in youth participation in \nthe labor market, especially those in college, due especially to improvements in \n\nTABLE 1\nDescriptive Statistics\n\n18\u201324 Years Old Mean/Proportion SD Min.

As long-term \nunemployment increased, so did the ranks of those who left the labor force.\n\nFigures 2a through 2c show trends of underemployment (informal work), \noccupational status, and working hours for youths still employed. While Figure 1 \nprovides evidence of youths\u2019 obstacles to secure a job, Figure 2a illustrates the \nquality of the occupations for those who found a way to remain employed. Figure \n2a shows a very marked difference in underemployment trends between young \nworkers and adults. Between 2012 and early 2014, informal work declines pro-\ngressively, but at the onset of the recession, underemployment rates among \nyoung workers start to take on an increasing trajectory, whereas adult underem-\nployment rates are relatively stable around 35 percent. The increasing rates are \nmostly accentuated among workers between 18 and 24 years of age, going from \n36 percent in 2014 to 43 percent in 2017.\n\nFigure 2b can be seen as a consequence of 2a: as the underemployment \nincreases, the occupational status (weighted average of income and education for \neach occupation) of the jobs held by young workers tends to decline. The \ndeclines, however, were small, about 1 point in the ISEI scale, during the \n\nFIGURE 1\nUnemployment, Long-Term Unemployment, and Labor Market Participation  \n\namong Brazilian Workers, 2012\u20132017\n\n\n\nRECESSION AND YOUTH LABOR MARKET PROSPECTS IN BRAZIL 47\n\nrecession. Taken together, Figures 2a and 2b show a complex pattern: while the \nranks of young people employed in the informal sector increased markedly, the \noccupational status of the jobs held by young people during the recession did not \nchange substantially. Young adults between 25 and 29 years of age held jobs with \nhigher average occupational status than adults, which can be explained by their \nrelatively higher educational attainment, and the fact that those who remained \nemployed are those with higher educational credentials.\n\nFigure 2c shows trends in working hours per week. It shows that adults work \nmore hours than young people, and that working hours declined for workers in \nall age groups. Although the downward trend started before the recession, since \nthe onset of the recession it is possible to depict a widening of the gap in work \nhours between youth (18 to 24 years old) and older workers.\n\nOverall, these figures show how the recession affects youths and adults differ-\nently, but also show distinct patterns between younger workers (between 18 and \n24 years of age), who were especially hard hit, and young adults (between 25 and \n29 years of age), which prompt us to separate the two categories in the propor-\ntional hazard models, discussed in the next section.\n\nProportional hazard models\n\nProportional hazard models measure the probability that an event will occur \nduring a specific period of time. In our models, we estimate the probability that \n\nFIGURE 2\nUnderemployment, Occupational Status, and Working Hours among Brazilian  \n\nWorkers, 2012\u20132017\n\n\n\n48 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nyoung Brazilians in the labor force will experience unemployment during the \nmost recent economic downturn (2016\u20132017). Table 2 shows results from these \nmodels estimating the effect of gender, race, schooling, age, and geographical \nlocation (metropolitan areas and regions of the country) on the hazards of unem-\nployment among Brazilian youth. Based on marked differences in trends \nobserved in the previous section, we estimate separate models for youth between \n18 and 24 years old (model 1) and those between 25 and 29 years old (model 2). \nAll coefficients of interest are statistically significant.\n\nIn model 1, the hazard ratio for gender is 1.324, which means that the hazard \nof unemployment for women is 1.324 times the hazard of unemployment for \nmen, that is, women have a hazard of unemployment that is 32.4 percent ([haz-\nard ratio-1]*100) higher than the hazard for men. Among older youth (model 2), \nwomen\u2019s hazard is even more accentuated, 44.8 percent higher than the hazard \nfor men.\n\nRace and educational credentials are also important predictors of the hazards \nof unemployment. Among younger youths, the hazard of unemployment is 9.2 \npercent higher for African Brazilians, and among older youth the hazard is 19.2 \npercent. College educated youth are less likely to be unemployed: their hazard \nof unemployment is 16.2 percent lower among younger youth, and 20.4 percent \namong those aged between 25 and 29 years old. Hazard ratios for geographical \ncontext show that youths in metropolitan areas have a higher hazard of unem-\nployment (26 percent and 23 percent) than youths living in smaller cities, or rural \nareas.\n\nTable 3 shows the hazard ratios of youth underemployment. The hazard of \nunderemployment is lower for young women (44 percent lower) than for young \nmen. Thus, while young women have higher hazards of unemployment, they \nhave lower hazards of underemployment. College-educated youth (25 percent \nand 34 percent, respectively), and those living in metropolitan areas (20 percent \nand 16 percent, respectively) also have lower hazards. For African Brazilian \nyouth, the hazard is 7 percent higher, among 18- to 24-year-old workers, and 10 \npercent higher among 25- to 29-year-olds than the hazard for white youth. It is \nimportant to note that the models in Table 3 capture the movement from formal \nemployment to informal work, but not from unemployment to informal work.\n\nFigures 3 to 5 plot the Kaplan-Meier estimates for the hazards of unemploy-\nment and underemployment according to gender, race, and education, respec-\ntively. The figures show the probability of survival in the labor market, for each \ncategory, at each wave of data collection. From wave 1 to wave 5, the probability \nof staying employed decreases for all categories, but they also show different \nprobabilities for each category: as economic activity and labor market indicators \nbecome worse, the gap in the probability of employment between men and \nwomen, white and nonwhite, and college-educated and less-educated youths \nbecomes wider.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimates for the hazards of underemployment show simi-\nlar trends, except for a reversed effect of gender. Different from the unemploy-\nment gap, men have increasingly lower chances of holding formal jobs than \nwomen. Black youth and those with lower educational credentials have \n\n\n\nRECESSION AND YOUTH LABOR MARKET PROSPECTS IN BRAZIL 49\n\nincreasingly lower chances of holding a formal job as the crisis intensifies, com-\npared to white and college-educated youths, respectively.\n\nDiscussion\n\nEconomic downturns disproportionally affect young people\u2019s labor market pros-\npects, and the most recent economic recession has harshly affected Brazilian \nyouths\u2019 work trajectories, with pronounced increases in unemployment rates and \nlong-term unemployment rates and decreasing levels of participation in the labor \nmarket. Underemployment rates were even more accentuated, indicating that in \na volatile labor market, youths who can remain employed are usually more likely \nthan adults to hold bad jobs.\n\nFindings from our survival models indicate that race, gender, and education \nare important predictors of the hazards of unemployment and underemployment \namong young workers. Young women and nonwhite youths have higher hazards \nof unemployment, along with those who did not pursue a college education. \nYoung women, although having higher hazards of unemployment than young \nmen, have lower hazards of underemployment.

Simultaneously, \nthe increasing effect of race as economic activity becomes lower shows not only \nthat decision-makers take race into account as a factor to dismiss workers, but \nalso that this racial bias intensifies as economic activity decreases, leading to \ngrowing racial inequalities in the labor market. And a college education was pro-\ntective against unemployment and underemployment for all workers.\n\nThe study, however, is not without limitations. First, because we opted for a \nbroad analysis of labor market trajectories, we did not analyze the specific types \nof jobs lost or held by young workers during the recession. Second, our analyses \nwould benefit from having a consistent indicator for rural areas (there is no vari-\nable for rural areas in the currently available PNAD Continua datasets), where \nunderemployment is even more pronounced than in urban and metropolitan \nareas. Future studies, however, should take these limitations into account to offer \na more complete picture of youth labor market trajectories in Brazil. Further \nresearch should also examine a longer period, maybe incorporating multiple pan-\nels from PNAD Continua. While our 15-month analysis allows us to estimate \nshort-term trajectories, a longer period would allow researchers to better under-\nstand how the recession impacted youths\u2019 trajectories in the long run.\n\nFuture research should also pay more attention to the role of public policies, \nor the lack thereof, that affect Brazilian youths\u2019 plight in the labor market. For \nexample, the expansion of policies designed to strengthen the links between \nschools and the labor market, such as federal technical high schools and col-\nleges\u2014called Federal Centers for Technological Education (CEFET)\u2014could \nprovide a smoother transition to the labor market for many young workers. Also, \nthe expansion of initiatives to guarantee that young African Brazilian workers \nhave the same employment opportunities as their white counterparts could play \nan important role in providing a more egalitarian transition for young people. \nFinally, further research should consider how changes in both the demographic \nstructure (such as the shrinking size of the youth population) and the socioeco-\nnomic structure (for example, the increasing proportion of college-educated \nyouths) of the population could affect youths\u2019 socioeconomic pathways.\n\nNotes\n\n1.
