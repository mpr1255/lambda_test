Retrospective life history data from a \n2017 survey in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan show \nthat higher education attainment has a strong positive \nimpact on labor market activity and getting a formal \nsector job. Early family formation drives young women \ninto inactivity, but it does not limit the chances of get-\nting access to the formal sector. The chances of getting \na formal sector job are positively influenced by the \nsocial resources of parents in Georgia and Tajikistan \nand by parents\u2019 economic resources in Azerbaijan and \nGeorgia. Evidence about the role of economic need \nand of traditionalism for women\u2019s labor market partici-\npation is mixed.\n\nKeywords: female labor force participation; school-\nto-work transition; informal work, educa-\ntion effects; family formation; parental \nresources; intergenerational transmission\n\nDespite increasing educational levels, \ndecreasing fertility rates, and global eco-\n\nnomic progress, women still face problems in \nlabor market integration around the world \n(Elder and Kring 2016; heyne 2017; Iannelli \nand Smyth 2008; Smyth 2005).

This article provides the first detailed multivariate analyses of wom-\nen\u2019s labor market integration in the CCA, drawing on newly collected, nationally \nrepresentative, retrospective life history data from Azerbaijan, Georgia, and \nTajikistan.\n\nWomen\u2019s disadvantages emerge quite early in working life, especially after \nmarriage and childbirth according to Western studies (brewster and Rindfuss \n2000; van der Lippe and van Dijk 2002). however, in developing countries, \nwomen\u2019s labor market disadvantage often arises during the school-to-work transi-\ntion in terms of lower rates of labor force participation and the types of jobs \nwomen usually enter (Elder and Kring 2016; Gebel and heyne 2014). Previous \nresearch has underlined the importance of this early transition event for the later \nlife course (buchmann and Kriesi 2011; Schoon and Silbereisen 2009). \nAccordingly, I focus on women at the beginning of their career. Moreover, \nanother central issue for women who enter the labor market is what kind of jobs \nthey get. For postsocialist countries, the employment sector type matters \n(G\u00ebrxhani 2004; G\u00ebrxhani and van de Werfhorst 2013; Kogan 2011), because a \nsubstantial share of women end up in informal job arrangements that are usually \npoor quality (G\u00ebrxhani 2004). This article also addresses this labor market divide.\n\nLikewise, I address social inequalities within the group of women studied \n(Gebel and heyne 2014). based on the observation that some subgroups of \nwomen are quite successful compared to others, the central research question \nhere is which individual- and family-level factors hamper or promote women\u2019s \nlabor market access and chances to get a formal sector job.\n\nThe article is organized as follows: I describe the background of the three \ncountries analyzed, and then discuss theoretical arguments about the effects of \ndifferent individual and family factors on young women\u2019s labor market chances. \nI then describe the dataset, variables, and methods used in this study and present \nthe results of the empirical analyses. Finally, I synthesize the findings of the \nempirical analyses and highlight which are the important individual- and family-\nlevel determinants of women\u2019s labor market chances in the CCA region. In this \nregard, I add depth to the established literature, which lacks an understanding of \nwomen\u2019s labor market integration in the CCA region.\n\nThe Structural, Institutional, and Cultural background\n\nAside from getting in-depth insights into young women\u2019s labor market chances in \nthree countries of the CCA region, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Taijkistan represent \nan interesting cross-country comparative setting. I argue that the three countries \nshare similarities (mainly in their institutional context) and differences (mainly in \ntheir economic development and the religious/cultural background). This allows \nme to formulate general expectations about all three countries given the cross-\ncountry similarities and country-specific expectations given the cross-country \ndifferences.\n\n\n\nYOuNG WOMEN\u2019S TRANSITION FROM EDuCATION TO WORK 139\n\nGeorgia, located at the black Sea, and Azerbaijan, located at the Caspian Sea, \nare countries in the Caucasus. Tajikistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia \nsharing a border with China. The three countries are of comparable size with \nsmall populations (2016: ~9.8 million in Azerbaijan, ~8.7 million in Tajikistan, \n~3.7 million in Georgia; World bank 2017). All three countries have ethnic \nminorities: Talysh, Lezgins, and Armenians in Azerbaijan; Armenians and Azeris \nin Georgia; and uzbeks in Tajikistan. Outward migration is common. In \nTajikistan, this takes place in the form of seasonal migration for work in Russia.\n\nAll three countries share the Soviet legacy. This is reflected in similarities in \nthe education systems that were characterized by strong education-occupation \nlinkages, strong vocational orientation, and exclusive tertiary education (Gerber \n2003). In the postsocialist period, education-occupation linkages were lost, voca-\ntional education came under pressure, and vigorous tertiary education expansion \nand differentiation took place in post-Soviet countries (Kogan, Noelke, and \nGebel 2011), including in Azerbaijan and Georgia but to a lesser extent in \nTajikistan.\n\nTraditionally, socialist societies and institutions have supported female labor \nforce integration (Gerber and Mayorova 2006; Kosyakova, Saar, and D\u00e4mmrich \n2017). Previous comparative research has underlined the importance of welfare-\nstate policies as well as cultural values concerning gender and family as macro-\nlevel determinants of female labor force participation (Pfau-Effinger 2005; \nSteiber and haas 2012). This may also explain why the post-Soviet Muslim socie-\nties have reached higher levels of female labor force participation than Muslim \nMiddle Eastern and Northern African (MENA) countries (heyne 2017).\n\nIn contrast to postsocialist countries that were not part of the Soviet union, \nAzerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan experienced a very long and problematic \ntransformation during the 1990s. The demise of the socialist state and the emer-\ngent capitalist order put an end to the lifetime employment guarantee and basic \neconomic security for young people (Kogan, Noelke, and Gebel 2011). Economic \nand political shocks due to civil wars and revolutions added additional uncertain-\nties in the lives of young people in these countries. The prevailing labor market \nproblems put the socialist heritage of gender egalitarianism under pressure, as it \nhad in Russia (Kosyakova, Kurakin, and blossfeld 2015). In addition, the transi-\ntion from socialism to capitalism removed external legal and institutional con-\nstraints on discrimination against women by employers (Gerber and Mayorova \n2006).\n\nThere are clear differences among the three countries in terms of economic \ndevelopment (gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, purchasing power parity \n[PPP] [current international $] in 2016: Azerbaijan, $17,282, Georgia, $10,024, \nTajikistan, $2,985) (World bank 2017) and human development (human \nDevelopment Index 2016: Georgia, 0.769, Azerbaijan, 0.759, Tajikistan, 0.627) \n(uNDP 2017). The three countries also differ in their religious backgrounds. \nWhile Georgia is dominated by the Orthodox Christian tradition, Azerbaijan is \nmainly Shia Muslim, and Tajikistan is mainly Sunni Muslim. Differences in reli-\ngion and economic development reflect cultural differences, which influence \nfemale labor market chances (heyne 2017). In the following theoretical \n\n\n\n140 ThE ANNALS OF ThE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nreflections, the differences in the countries\u2019 economic development and their \nreligious/cultural backgrounds are the main reasons for expected cross-country \ndifferences in women\u2019s labor market integration.\n\nTheories and hypotheses\n\nLabor market inactivity\n\nA person\u2019s choice to participate in the labor market is a constrained rational \nchoice decision. We can assume that the decision is not made only by young \nwomen themselves but is influenced or even determined by their parents or their \nhusbands if they are married. Of the three countries studied here, family is \nexpected to play the most important role in Tajikistan, which is less modernized \nand predominantly Muslim; a lesser role in the more-developed Azerbaijan; and \na lesser role still in Orthodox Christian Georgia.\n\nThe decision to participate in the labor market is bounded by social values. If \ntraditional values prevail, young women will remain at home (hakim 2000). I \nexpect traditional values to prevail, especially in families with a low level of \nparental education, among women growing up in rural areas, and among very \nreligious women. Traditionalism may also be expressed if the mother did not \nwork and such traditional values of women staying at home are transmitted across \ngenerations (Farr\u00e9 and Vella 2013). I hypothesize that traditionalism, especially \nreligious-based traditionalism, effects are stronger in the Muslim societies of \nAzerbaijan and Tajikistan as compared to the Orthodox Christian Georgia \n(Moghadam 2003; Spierings, Smits, and Verloo 2009).\n\nWithin these societies, one would expect women to opt for labor market inac-\ntivity if the utility of labor market inactivity exceeds the utility of labor market \nparticipation. based on human capital theory, we should also expect that higher \nlevels of educational attainment raise the utility of labor market participation \n(becker 1964; van der Lippe and van Dijk 2002). The utility of labor market \nparticipation is also very high if young women live in poor households, as such \nhouseholds may be in need of any kind of income (Steiber and haas 2012). A \nsimilar argument can be applied to women who have grown up with fewer than \ntwo parents, because in such cases their contribution to the family income might \nbe especially needed as well. The economic need argument should most apply to \nless modernized Tajikistan.\n\nThe expected utility of housework is determined by the demand for household \nand care work from the family of origin and the family of destination. Specifically, \nin larger families and in the case of a relatively larger number of brothers, there \nis more demand for housework and care (Steiber and haas 2012). hence, I \nexpect that women in large families and with a relatively large number of male \nsiblings are less likely to enter the labor market. In the case of early family forma-\ntion, the concurrent transition to early first marriage and early first parenthood \npaves the way for young women to enter the role of caregivers and house work-\ners, while young men take the role of the sole breadwinner. This applies primarily \n\n\n\nYOuNG WOMEN\u2019S TRANSITION FROM EDuCATION TO WORK 141\n\nto patriarchal Muslim societies (Moghadam 2003; Spierings, Smits, and Verloo \n2010).\n\nFormal sector employment\n\nIn CCA countries a main aspect of job quality is whether a labor market \nentrant finds a formal (registered) job or an informal (unregistered) job. A formal \n(registered) job means that income taxes for the specific job are paid either by \nthe employer or employee; this is not the case for informal (unregistered) jobs. \nFormal jobs are usually preferred by young women for several reasons. First, \ninformal jobs generate low income in transformation societies (G\u00ebrxhani and van \nde Werfhorst 2013). Furthermore, formal jobs are usually associated with having \na working contract and social security coverage. There is a historic pattern of \nstrong sex-specific occupational segregation in post-Soviet countries, with female \nemployment concentrated in the formal sector such as occupations in the educa-\ntion sector or public sector (Gerber and Mayorova 2006; Kosyakova, Kurakin, \nand blossfeld 2015). As mentioned, informal sector jobs are a second choice \nbecause of their low quality. Taking a job in the family business can be seen as \npart of the informal sector because jobs in the family business are usually on an \ninformal basis without any work contract. They often offer no chance of career \nadvancement as the succession rules in the family business sector clearly privi-\nlege men.\n\nEducation certificates are used to signal young applicants\u2019 productivity and \ntrainability (S\u00f8rensen and Kalleberg 1981). Thus, higher education puts appli-\ncants in a better position when competing for formal sector jobs (Kogan 2011). \nJobs in the public sector are often filled according to meritocratic selection pro-\ncedures, whereas access to the private informal sector and the family business \nsector works mainly via social ties and family resources in transition countries \n(G\u00ebrxhani and van de Werfhorst 2013; Kogan 2011; Kogan, Matkovic, and Gebel \n2013).\n\nThe family of origin is expected to affect labor market opportunities because \nit provides social and economic resources during the job search (Granovetter \n1974). having parents who work in a certain sector may pave the way to that sec-\ntor because of social contacts. Young people from rich families may be able to \nendure a long waiting process for formal sector jobs (Gebel and heyne 2014). I \nhypothesize that family background should play a stronger role in the less mod-\nern Tajik society compared to Azerbaijan and Georgia, where meritocratic prin-\nciples are more relevant.\n\nMoreover, family formation may play a role in the sector choice, particularly \nin Muslim countries. Marriage may signal upcoming childbirths and childbearing \nmay reduce the likelihood of a job offer because employers, particularly those in \nthe informal sector, hesitate in hiring females who would have the dual responsi-\nbility of work and family (Spierings, Smits, and Verloo 2009). This kind of dis-\ncrimination should be less prevalent in the formal sector, specifically the public \nsector, because of stricter legal enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in the \nformal sector. Moreover, the better provision and legal enforcement of \n\n\n\n142 ThE ANNALS OF ThE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nfamily-friendly working hours, maternity leave, family/child allowances, and \nemployment protection should make the formal sector the preferred choice for \nmarried women and mothers.\n\nData, Variables, and Methods\n\nData and sample\n\nI use retrospective life history data from the TEW-CCA Youth Transition \nSurveys in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan that were collected from October \n2016 to February 2017 (Gebel et\u00a0al. 2018). Overall, 6,002 standardized face-to-\nface interviews were conducted. The surveys had national coverage, excluding \nonly territories in Georgia and Azerbaijan that were occupied by Russia and \nArmenia as well as very remote mountainous areas. The source questionnaires \nwere developed in English and translated into Azeri, Georgian, Tajik, and \nRussian.\n\nA multistage stratified random sampling was carried out. based on a complete \nlist of districts by region, districts and clusters were randomly selected. \nhouseholds within each cluster were selected via route-random selection. \nFinally, eligible respondents were screened and randomly selected in each \nhousehold. Design weights were calculated for each country to account for dif-\nferent selection probabilities.\n\nThe target group is made up of individuals aged 18 to 35 who had left educa-\ntion in the 10 years preceding the survey. Leaving education is defined as finish-\ning formal education (either successfully completing it or dropping out). \nRespondents are classified as being in formal education if the respondent com-\nbined formal education with other activities (e.g., work), if students were on \nvacation, paternity leave, or sick leave; or if students were on pending status and \nneither working nor looking for work at the moment of the survey and planning \nto continue study in the near future.\n\nDependent variables and methods\n\nSeparate analyses were performed for the labor force participation decision \nand the type of first employment. The labor force participation decision was \nanalyzed using a binary indicator, taking the value of one for young women who \nopted for labor market inactivity after leaving education and zero for unemployed \nor employed women.\n\nbased on a monthly economic activity calendar, any first job, including short-\nterm, casual work, and unregistered work, was identified. Women starting their \nworking life as self-employed or employers were excluded because different \nexplanatory factors for a formal/registered business are expected and due to the \nsmall number of cases. A formal (registered) job means that income taxes for the \nspecific job are paid either by the employer or employee; this is not the case for \ninformal (unregistered) jobs. First jobs as family helpers are defined as part of \n\n\n\nYOuNG WOMEN\u2019S TRANSITION FROM EDuCATION TO WORK 143\n\nthe informal sector because jobs in the family business are usually organized in \nan informal way. For both dependent variables, I employ binary logistic regres-\nsion analysis and estimate average marginal effects (AMEs).\n\nIndependent variables\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of descriptive statistics of the dependent and \nindependent variables for the two analytical samples for each country. My work-\ning sample consists of 996 women in Azerbaijan, 1,196 women in Georgia, and \n964 women in Tajikistan for the analysis of labor force participation (sample 1). \nThe sample for access to formal sector jobs (sample 2) consists of 459 women in \nAzerbaijan, 695 women in Georgia, and 397 women in Tajikistan, who were in \nemployment in their first job at the time of the survey. All descriptive statistics \nand multivariate analyses are weighted using national design weights.\n\nA central independent variable in both analyses is education, which is defined \non the basis of the highest school and vocational degree obtained when leaving \neducation. I differentiate between students with qualifications of basic secondary \nor less, upper secondary, initial professional, secondary professional, undergradu-\nate bA, and graduate MA/PhD degrees. The need for labor market participation \nis measured by a proxy variable of parental wealth. Respondents were asked to \nsubjectively assess the wealth in their parental home at age 15. A dummy variable \nfor growing up with fewer than two parents is included as another measure of \neconomic need.\n\nIn the analysis of labor force participation, traditionalism is proxied by several \nmeasures. First, the highest level of parental education at the time when the \nrespondent was 15 years old is measured. Second, using a yearly calendar on resi-\ndential changes since the birth of the respondent, the share of time lived in rural \nareas from birth until the time of leaving education is used. Third, women are \nasked about the importance of religion in their personal lives at the time of the \nsurvey.1 Fourth, as a measure of intergenerational transmission of traditional \nvalues, respondents were asked if their mothers worked when the respondent \nwas 15 years old.\n\nMoreover, when analyzing the participation decision, the utility of housework \nin the family of origin is captured by the number of brothers and sisters. I assume \nthat in larger families and especially in families with a larger share of sons, there \nis an increased demand for housework and care. The additional utility of house-\nwork in the family of destination is captured by the event of early marriage and \nearly childbirth. both family formation events are defined as occurring early in \nthe life course if they happened before the date of leaving education or at the \ndate of leaving education.2 This conservative measure should reduce the problem \nof reversed causality in terms of labor market decisions affecting family formation \nbehavior.\n\nIn the analysis of first job type, family networks and resources are investigated \nby parental wealth (see above) and father\u2019s and mother\u2019s type of employment. \nAccording to the dependent variables, I distinguish between parental formal \nemployment and informal employment (including family helpers).

I include both father\u2019s and mother\u2019s \nemployment type to capture gender-specific transmission mechanisms of social \nties and resources.\n\nAs control variables I use the date of leaving education (education leaver \ncohorts 2011\u20132015 vs. 2006\u20132010), a dummy variable for belonging to an ethnic \nminority, and a dummy variable for disability in the analysis of labor force partici-\npation. When analyzing the chances of getting a formal sector job, the share of \ntime lived in rural areas and the number of brothers and sisters are used as addi-\ntional control variables. All models are estimated separately for each country to \nallow for full variation of the estimated effects across countries.\n\nEmpirical Results\n\nLabor market inactivity\n\nStarting with basic descriptive analyses of my working sample, I find that 26 \npercent of all Georgian women leaving education between 2006 and 2016 \nbecame inactive (see Table 1). The share is much higher in Azerbaijan (40 per-\ncent) and in Tajikistan (49 percent). Thus, the inactivity rate is higher in the two \nMuslim countries than in the Orthodox Christian country. The inactivity rate is \nhighest in Tajikistan, which is characterized by both a Muslim tradition and lower \nlevels of economic development. Overall, between a quarter and a half of women \ndo not engage in labor market activities.\n\nIn the following multivariate analysis, I investigate various individual- and \nfamily-level determinants of the labor force participation decision according to \nmy theoretical model. My multivariate analyses confirm that education has a \nnegative impact on the decision to stay at home in all three countries, even after \naccounting for family background (see Table 2). The education effects are rather \nlinear: the higher the education, the higher the activity rate.3 however, there are \na few exceptions to this pattern. upper secondary graduates have only a small \nrelative advantage (in Tajikistan, no advantage), which is much smaller than the \neffects for professional and tertiary education. bA undergraduates have a higher \nprobability of being inactive than vocational education and training (VET) stu-\ndents with either initial or secondary professional education in Tajikistan.\n\nIn line with the economic need argument, women from poor families have \nhigher rates of labor market activity in Georgia and Tajikistan compared to \nwomen whose families had average or above average wealth. however, the \neffects are not statistically significant. The wealth effect is negative in Azerbaijan \nbut also statistically insignificant.

Interestingly, having more sisters decreases the inactivity rate in \nTajikistan. In other words, women have stronger labor market attachments if \nthere are a higher number of sisters in the household. Clear support for the \nhypothesis that an increased demand for housework and care activities drives \nyoung women into labor market activity is evident when looking at the effects of \nfamily formation. Specifically, I find that an early transition to first marriage sig-\nnificantly increases the probability of full-time housework in Azerbaijan and \nGeorgia. In contrast, the first birth does not have any additional independent \ninfluence after controlling for the marriage effect in Azerbaijan and Georgia. \nThus, the central event that hinders labor market activity of young women in \nAzerbaijan and Georgia seems to be early marriage and not childbirth. A differ-\nent pattern can be found in Tajikistan, where childbirth is the decisive event \nincreasing inactivity rates, while being married is still compatible with labor mar-\nket engagement.\n\nI find mixed evidence for the proxy measures of traditionalism after control-\nling for education attainment and family formation.4 The results show that the \nshare of time spent in rural areas increases inactivity in Azerbaijan and Georgia. \nIn Tajikistan, the point estimate is negative, but the effect is very small and sta-\ntistically insignificant. After controlling for the process of attainment in education \nas the central mediating mechanism of social mobility, low parental education \nonly slightly increases the probability of being inactive in the labor market. \nhowever, the coefficients are not statistically significant. having an inactive \nmother increases the probability of labor market inactivity. This effect is large \nand statistically significant only in Tajikistan. As I also control for parental wealth, \nthe effect of having an inactive mother on the probability of labor market inactiv-\nity can be seen as a measure of intergenerational transmission of traditional val-\nues.5 In a comparative perspective, this is also the only effect that is in line with \nmy expectation that traditionalism has a stronger effect in the less developed \nTajik society. Religiosity does not show any statistically significant effect in all \nthree countries in the multivariate models. Thus, individual religiosity does not \nhave any direct effect once education attainment, various family background \ncharacteristics, rural socialization, and events of own family formation are con-\ntrolled for. There is not even an effect in the Muslim societies where stronger \nreligion effects were expected.\n\nFormal sector employment\n\nIn the second step of my analyses, I investigate the subsample of young \nwomen who are employed or self-employed. Specifically, I analyze the kind of \nfirst jobs young women enter.\n\nTable 3 provides descriptive statistics on the kind of first job. Among the Azeri \nwomen who found a first job during my observation window, 77 percent suc-\nceeded in finding a job as a formal employee, 15 percent took a job as an informal \nemployee, 4 percent became family employees/helpers in family businesses, and \n3 percent became self-employed. The patterns are quite similar in Georgia with \n77 percent in formal employment, 18 percent in informal employment, 2 percent \n\n\n\n148 ThE ANNALS OF ThE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nfamily employees/helpers, and 3 percent self-employed. however, in Tajikistan, \nthere is a different pattern, because the informal sector is larger and there are \nmore self-employed women at entry into the labor market; this is in line with the \nlower economic development there. Specifically, 64 percent succeeded in finding \na job as a formal employee, 24 percent took a job as an informal employee, 3 \npercent became family employees/helpers in family businesses, and 9 percent \nbecame self-employed. Overall, formal employment is the dominant employ-\nment form for all women entering the labor market in the three CCA countries. \nThe share of young women who took over the family business or founded their \nown business when entering the labor market is quite low. For the following \nanalyses, self-employed women are excluded.\n\nTable 4 offers some supplementary descriptive analyses on the quality of \nfemale employment in different employment sectors. In line with my theoretical \nexpectation, formal sector jobs are of the highest quality because they offer for-\nmal contractual work, rather high levels of social security contributions, and \noccupational positions with potential for advancement. In contrast, informal sec-\ntor jobs are often without any work contract, without social security, and offer \nvery little prospects for career advancement. A similar pattern emerges in the \nfamily business sector in Azerbaijan and Georgia. In Tajikistan, some jobs in the \nfamily business come with contracts, social security coverage, and offer access to \nhigher occupational positions (managerial, professional or technical level). \nhowever, the family business sector in Tajikistan is still much closer in its char-\nacteristics to informal employment than to formal employment. based on my \nresults, it seems reasonable to consider family business as part of the informal job \nsector in all three countries.\n\nTable 5 summarizes the results of multivariate analysis on the individual- and \nfamily-level determinants of getting a formal sector job. There is a positive asso-\nciation between higher education and the chances of finding a formal sector job \nin all three countries. The education effect is not linear in Azerbaijan and \nTajikistan; there is a threshold effect instead.

Similarly, the probability of getting a for-\nmal sector job is 60 to 67 percentage points higher for women with secondary \nprofessional education or higher levels of education compared to women with \nlower levels of education in Tajikistan. In contrast, the point estimates in Georgia \nshow a linear trend and are smaller in magnitude. Compared to the reference \ngroup of women with basic secondary education or less, Georgian women with \ninitial or secondary professional degrees have a 7 to 8 percentage point higher \nprobability of getting a formal sector job. The effect is 16 percentage points for \nwomen with an undergraduate bA degree and 22 percentage points for graduates \nwith an MA or PhD. however, only the effects for tertiary education are statisti-\ncally significant in Georgia. The weaker education effects in Georgia might be \nrelated to the relatively stronger degree of educational expansion that may have \ndevaluated higher education degrees.\n\nI find that in Georgia, women from richer families have a 15 percent higher \nprobability of getting access to the formal job sector compared to those from poor \nfamilies.

In all three countries, there is \nsome evidence for the effects of parental social resources. Women with fathers \nor mothers working in formal sector jobs have higher chances of getting access to \nthe formal job sector compared to women with fathers or mothers working in \ninformal sector jobs. Thus, there is an intergenerational transmission of sector \nemployment patterns. These effects are strong and statistically significant as \nexpected in Tajikistan but also in Georgia. As I control for parental wealth in the \nsame model, the effects could be interpreted as the sector-specific social net-\nworks and insider information that pave the way for the daughters. Interestingly, \nboth effects of mothers and fathers are significant even when simultaneously \nentered in my model. The effects are slightly stronger for mother\u2019s employment \nstatus, which hints to a stronger intergenerational transmission along gender \nlines. I also find some strong positive effects of nonworking fathers in Tajikistan \nand nonworking mothers in Georgia.\n\nI get positive point estimates for the effects of early marriage and early child-\nbirth on the probability of getting access to formal sector jobs in all three coun-\ntries. Experiencing early family formation seems to be more compatible with a \nformal sector job among those women who actually find a job. however, the \neffects never reach statistical significance.\n\nI find that growing up in a rural area increases the chances of getting access to \na formal sector job in Azerbaijan, while the opposite pattern emerges in Georgia \nand Tajikistan. however, the effect only reaches statistical significance in \nAzerbaijan. There is only a limited influence of the number of brothers and sis-\nters after controlling for parental wealth and employment status. These variables \nwere used to account for sibling rivalry over parental economic and social \nresources. being from an ethnic minority significantly reduces the chances of \ngetting access to the formal job sector in Georgia and Tajikistan even after con-\ntrolling for social origin, education effects, and rural/urban differences. There is \nno evidence of disability being a hurdle to the formal job sector among those \npeople who found a first job. Over time, there is growing female employment in \nthe formal sector in Georgia and Tajikistan, whereas there is no time trend in \nAzerbaijan.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy descriptive analysis confirms expectations of this cross-country comparison of \nthe individual- and family-level factors that pave the way to the labor market and \nto formal sector jobs for women in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. A sub-\nstantial share of women do not engage in labor market activities in all three \ncountries. Inactivity rates are higher in the two Muslim countries than in the \nOrthodox Christian country and highest in Tajikistan, which is predominantly \nMuslim and the least developed of the three countries. There is still a substantial \nproportion of women who work in the informal sector at the beginning of their \n\n\n\n152 ThE ANNALS OF ThE AMERICAN ACADEMY\n\nworking careers, which is highest in the least developed country of Tajikistan. \nNevertheless, formal employment is the dominant form of employment for all \nwomen entering the labor market in these three CCA countries.\n\nThe multivariate results reveal that education has a strong negative impact on \nthe decision to stay at home in all three countries. With a very few exceptions, the \neducation effects are rather linear; that is, the higher the education level, the \nhigher the labor market participation. Similarly, the multivariate analyses confirm \nthat higher education paves the way to jobs in the formal sector. In cross-country \ncomparisons, the education effects, particularly related to getting a formal sector \njob, are smaller in Georgia, which might have been caused by the broad higher \neducation expansion in Georgia reducing the labor market returns on education. \nNevertheless, the general finding of rather strong education effects in all the \nanalyses reveals the value of higher education certificates to labor market success \nin the three developing countries, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Despite the \nconcerns about the low quality of education given the rapid expansion of educa-\ntion and concerns about weak links between the education system and employers, \nthere are still high labor market returns on education across the countries.\n\nAnother general finding across countries is that early family formation plays an \nimportant role in the decision to become inactive in the labor market, but there \nis no evidence that early family formation affects the rate at which women get \nformal sector jobs. Thus, early family formation is a hurdle for women\u2019s labor \nmarket integration in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. however, once settled \nin the labor market with a job, early family formation does not limit the chances \nof getting access to the formal job sector.\n\nThere is mixed evidence for the influence of the proxy measures of traditional-\nism, after controlling for education attainment and family formation. Particularly, \nreligiosity does not show any statistically significant direct effect on the inactivity \ndecision once education attainment, various family background characteristics, \nrural socialization, and own family formation are controlled for. As expected, if at \nall, traditionalism plays a stronger role in less developed Tajikistan. The limited \ndirect influence of individual measures of traditionalism on women\u2019s school-to-\nwork transition does not imply that traditionalism is not important at all. For \nexample, traditionalism might be a hurdle to girls\u2019 education attainment, which \nwas shown to be a very important factor for women\u2019s labor market integration.\n\nAcross countries, there is also evidence for direct effects of parental economic \nand social resources on women\u2019s school-to-work transition. Parental economic \nresources are shown to play a role in Georgia and Azerbaijan for finding a job in \nthe formal sector, while this is not the case in Tajikistan. Parental economic \nresources, as a measure of economic needs, did not directly affect women\u2019s labor \nmarket inactivity decision. Parental social resources are important for finding a \nformal sector job in Georgia and Tajikistan. Thus, there is an intergenerational \ntransmission of sector employment patterns. The effects are slightly stronger for \nmother\u2019s employment status, which is evidence of a stronger intergenerational \ntransmission along gender lines.\n\nIn sum, this work shows that there are various individual- and family-level fac-\ntors that influence women\u2019s school-to-work transition. by providing insights into \n\n\n\nYOuNG WOMEN\u2019S TRANSITION FROM EDuCATION TO WORK 153\n\nthe reasons for within-group inequalities among young women at labor market \nentry, the analyses specifically outline which factors foster women\u2019s school-to-\nwork transition and what the hurdles are that policy-makers may address if they \naim for better labor market integration of women. The comparative view reveals \nthat there are common patterns in the determinants of labor market participa-\ntion, but there are also cross-country differences that were related to the similari-\nties and differences of the three countries considered here. This study provides \nnew insights into a region of the world for which there is limited empirical evi-\ndence, but there is still a need for further comparative research. Further efforts \nwill require collection of retrospective or prospective longitudinal data on other \ncountries in the CCA region as well.\n\nNotes\n\n1. While the first two measures date back to the time before leaving education, the third measure of \ntraditionalism is potentially endogenous to the labor market decision. Results of sensitivity analysis on the \ninclusion versus exclusion of this variable are reported in the section on empirical results.\n\n2. This variable is coded as 1 if a person is married before leaving education (e.g., marriage age 18 and \nage of leaving education is 19) or at the date of leaving education (e.g., marriage age 18 and age of leaving \neducation is 18). It is coded as 0 if a person married after leaving education (e.g., marriage age 18 and age \nof leaving education is 17).\n\n3. Sensitivity analyses show that the education effects become slightly larger if potentially endogenous \nvariables such as family formation or religiosity are not controlled for. The order of the education effects \nand the conclusions are not changed.\n\n4. Sensitivity analyses show that the results do not substantially differ if the various proxies of tradition-\nalism are entered separately into the model.\n\n5. Alternatively, the effect of having an inactive mother on the probability of labor market inactivity can \nbe interpreted as an effect of social capital on the probability of labor market inactivity. A young woman \ncan profit from her mother\u2019s work experience and social contacts in the labor market.\n\nReferences\n\nbecker, Gary S. 1964.
