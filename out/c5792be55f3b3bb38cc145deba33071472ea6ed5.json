Our \ndiscussion highlights key implications of identity theory \nas it relates to family complexity and proposes several \nhypotheses for future empirical research, such as the \ngreater likelihood of role conflict in families with greater \ncomplexity and limited resources.

In addition to coresident \nmarried relationships (with or without children), many adults will engage in \ncohabitation prior to or after having children, as well as in nonresident and sem-\niresident (living together part of the time) romantic and parental relationships. \nFamilies comprising various combinations of married and unmarried, opposite- \nand same-sex partners, and biological and social (nonbiological) parents are also \ncommon, as are families that include full, half, and stepsiblings; couples living \ntogether-apart or apart-together; adult children living with parents; and elder \nparents living with adult children. Shared physical and legal custody of children \nfollowing parental union dissolution is also on the rise (Berger et al. 2008). Such \ndiversity and fluidity in family forms mean that adults and children are likely to \ntake on multiple family roles, and that many children will be exposed to multiple \ntypes of parental figures, both simultaneously and over time. these demographic \ntrends have important implications for social norms and family functioning vis-\u00e0-\nvis adults\u2019 roles as partners and parents.\n\nIn this article, we first use data from the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National \nLongitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to determine the likelihood that young \nmen and women will take on a variety of adult family roles by age 30. A complete \naccounting of all possible adult family roles is beyond the scope of our analyses \nand also precluded by limitations of currently available data. we are interested in \nparental roles; thus we do not incorporate partnering relationships for childless \ncouples. Instead, we focus on a somewhat parsimonious set of common family \nroles, including resident cohabiting or married biological parent, nonresident \nbiological parent following a marital or nonmarital birth, and cohabiting or mar-\nried resident social parent (unrelated coresident partner or spouse of a biological \nparent). we also discuss how the chances that young adults will occupy particular \nfamily roles have changed across cohorts. Finally, we estimate the likelihood of \nyoung adults experiencing specific trajectories in family formation (union forma-\ntion and first-time childbearing) by age 30. After describing these patterns, we \ndraw from identity theory and related theoretical work to describe how the mul-\ntiple family roles that adults are likely to occupy as partners and parents\u2014both \nover their life course and at a single point in time\u2014may influence interfamily and \nintrafamily (unit) relationships in light of current trends in family complexity. \nFinally, we present implications for future research and public policy.\n\nPatterns of Family Complexity among Young Adults: \nevidence from NLSY79 and NLSY97\n\nData and measures\n\nwe use parallel samples from two nationally representative, longitudinal \ncohorts of the NLSY to estimate the cumulative proportion of young adults who \n\n\n\nYOUNg ADULtS\u2019 ROLeS AS PARtNeRS AND PAReNtS 89\n\nexperienced a variety of roles as partners and parents between ages 17 and 30.1 \nthe NLSY97 sample consists of just under 9,000 young adults. the full NLSY79 \nsample consists of 12,686 young adults but includes oversamples of poor, non-\nhispanic whites, and individuals in the military. we excluded these oversamples \nto enhance the comparability of the cohorts. As such, our NLSY79 analysis sam-\nple consisted of 9,763 young men and women.\n\nAt each interview, the NLSY collects information on whether respondents are \nmarried, cohabiting, or single (not living with a coresident partner or spouse), have \nbiological children in their household, have social children (the children of the \nrespondent\u2019s married or cohabiting partner) in their household, and have biologi-\ncal children living elsewhere (nonresident children).2 we combined these meas-\nures to document which respondents inhabited a series of specific roles in each \nsurvey wave. these roles included single, married, or cohabiting with resident \nbiological children; single, married, or cohabiting with resident social children; \nand single, married, or cohabiting with nonresident biological children. we also \nconstructed indicators for various combinations of parental roles that respondents \nmay have experienced simultaneously and/or sequentially: having both resident \nbiological children and nonresident biological children, having both resident bio-\nlogical children and resident social children, and having resident social children \nand nonresident biological children. Finally, we considered whether respondents \nsimultaneously or sequentially experienced any combination of parental roles, and \nwhether they simultaneously or sequentially experienced all three parental roles. \nIn addition to these analyses based on the respondents\u2019 household composition, \nwe also conducted analyses that reflect respondents\u2019 reports of the total number \nof live births they have had at each survey wave. this information, combined with \ntheir marital status at each wave, was used to estimate the proportion of young \nadults having marital, cohabiting, or single first births by age 30 and to distinguish \nimportant subgroups within each of these three categories.\n\nOur analyses focused on estimating the proportion of respondents who expe-\nrienced these roles at some point by age 30. to do so, we used kaplan-Meier \nsurvival models, which account for the right-censoring in the NLSY97 data (not \nall respondents had reached age 30 by the most recent interview). we present \nestimates for the full sample, as well as separately for men and women. we also \npresent some estimates separately by race/ethnicity (white, non-hispanic, and \nother; black, non-hispanic; and hispanic) and educational attainment (less than \na high school education, a high school degree or geD, some college, and a bach-\nelor\u2019s degree or higher level of educational attainment by the most recent survey \nyear).3 we present our results both graphically and in tabular form. All analyses \nwere weighted to account for the complex sampling designs and attrition.\n\nwe emphasize that our estimates are relevant only to young adults (those ages \n30 and under), and cannot be generalized to the entire stage of adulthood. this is \nimportant for two primary reasons. First, our estimates cannot be viewed as a \ncomparison of whether men or women in a given cohort will ever occupy a par-\nticular role. For example, if some roles were simply postponed to later ages (after \nage 30) in the more recent cohort, individuals would not yet have been observed \nin those roles, though they may be equally likely to hold them over the full course \n\n\n\n90 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nof adulthood. Second, it is well established that less socioeconomically advantaged \nindividuals begin family formation at younger ages than their more advantaged \ncounterparts; the former are also disproportionately likely to experience family \ncomplexity. Because our analyses extend only to age 30, they necessarily overrep-\nresent the family formation experiences of less-advantaged individuals.\n\nResults\n\nMarried, single, and cohabiting young adults with resident biological children.  \nthe cumulative proportion of young adults who had experienced each family type \nby age 30 is presented in table 1, for the full sample and by respondents\u2019 sex. \nApproximately 59 percent of the 1979 cohort and 54 percent of the 1997 cohort \nreported living with a biological child in at least one survey wave from ages 17\u201330. \nthe data indicate that the likelihood that a young adult had been married and liv-\ning with resident biological children by age 30 was considerably higher in the \nearlier cohort than the later cohort (51 percent vs. 36 percent). In contrast, the \nlikelihood of cohabiting and living with resident biological children by age 30 was \nabout three times more in the more recent cohort than in the earlier cohort  \n(24 percent vs. 8 percent). having spent time as a single, resident parent by age \n30 was also more common in the more recent cohort (21 percent vs. 15 percent).\n\nFigures 1A and 1B display the cumulative proportion of young adults between \nages 17 and 30 who had biological children with whom they had coresided, by sex \nand partnership type (estimates at age 30 are also presented in table 1).

In contrast, \nabout 16 percent of adults in the earlier cohort had cohabited with a partner (and \ntheir joint biological child[ren]) prior to becoming a single parent, whereas this \nwas true of 43 percent of young adults in the more recent cohort.\n\nFIgURe 1A\nCumulative Proportion Ever Living with Resident Biological Children, Males\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\nC\n\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nve\n\n p\nro\n\np\nor\n\nti\non\n\nNLSY79 single\n\nNLSY97 single\n\nNLSY79 married\n\nNLSY97 married\n\nNLSY79 cohabiting\n\nNLSY97 cohabiting\n\nAge 17\u201330\n\nFIgURe 1B\nCumulative Proportion Ever Living with Resident Biological Children, Females\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nC\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\n\nve\n p\n\nro\np\n\nor\nti\n\non\n\nNLSY79 single\n\nNLSY97 single\n\nNLSY79 married\n\nNLSY97 married\n\nNLSY79 cohabiting\n\nNLSY97 cohabiting\n\nAge 17\u201330\n\n\n\n92 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nMarried and cohabiting young adults with resident social children. the cumula-\ntive proportion of young adults who lived with social children by age 30, by partner-\nship type, is also shown in table 1.

Most \ncommonly, young adults in both cohorts experienced multiple parental roles con-\nsisting of having resident biological children as well as having either nonresident \nbiological children or resident social children.

For \nexample, 50 percent of all young adults (74 percent of those who had a first birth \nby age 30) in the 1979 cohort had a first birth within marriage; this was true for \nonly 28 percent (45 percent) of those in the 1997 cohort. this change reflects two \ntrends. First, relative to individuals in the 1979 cohort, those in the 1997 cohort \ntended to wait until they were older to have their first birth. Second, individuals \nin the 1997 cohort were more likely than those in the 1979 cohort to have had a \nnonmarital first birth, either while they were cohabiting or single. Only 4 percent \nof young adults (6 percent of those who had a first birth by age 30) in the 1979 \ncohort had a first birth while cohabiting, whereas this was true for 16 percent  \n(26 percent) of the 1997 cohort. In addition, whereas 14 percent of young adults \n(20 percent of those who had a first birth by age 30) in the 1979 cohort had a first \nbirth while single (neither cohabiting nor married), this was true for 17 percent \n(28 percent) of the 1997 cohort.\n\nthe data also reveal several other trends over time with regard to the sequenc-\ning of partnerships and first-time childbearing among young adults. First, indi-\nviduals in the 1997 cohort were more likely than those in the 1979 cohort to have \ncohabited prior to marrying and (subsequently) having a first birth (10 percent \nvs. 6 percent). Second, those young adults in the 1997 cohort who had their first \nbirth within marriage were considerably less likely than those in the 1979 cohort \nto subsequently separate or divorce by age 30 (9 percent vs. 3 percent). third, \nyoung adults in the 1979 cohort who had a first birth within cohabitation were \nmore likely to subsequently break up with their cohabiting partner than were \nthose in the 1997 cohort. Roughly one-half of those in the 1979 cohort who were \ncohabiting at the time of their first birth were subsequently still cohabiting or got \nmarried by age 30, whereas about one-half had broken up. In contrast, roughly \n60 percent of those in the 1997 cohort were still cohabiting or got married, \nwhereas about 40 percent had broken up.\n\nSummary. On the whole, these results demonstrate that young adults inhabit \na variety of partner and parental roles during late adolescence and early adult-\nhood. In some ways, the experiences of these two cohorts vary quite dramati-\ncally\u2014in the proportion ever having been married with children versus \ncohabiting with children, and in the proportion having had a first birth in the \ncontext of cohabitation rather than marriage, for example, as well as in the prob-\nability of occupying multiple simultaneous or sequential parental roles, which \nhas increased substantially over time. In other ways, however, their experiences \nby age 30 seem similar. Across both cohorts, we consistently find that young men \nare more likely than young women to inhabit multiple parental roles (both \nsimultaneously and sequentially), and that rates of complexity are higher for \nlower socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority men and women. we next \ndiscuss how these demographic trends are related to theoretical conceptualiza-\ntions of young adults\u2019 identities and roles in the context of romantic relationships \nand parenthood.\n\n\n\n98 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nImplications of Identity theory for Adults\u2019  \nRoles as Partners and Parents in the  \n\nContext of Family Complexity\n\nOverview of identity theory\n\nIdentity theory is concerned with how individuals\u2019 actions and interactions \nportray their self-concepts within and in relation to particular social structures, \ncontexts, and situations; it is explicitly relational, interactional, and context-\ndriven\u2014rather than individual-centric\u2014in nature (Burke and Stets 2009). As \nsuch, it is well suited for considering systems of relationships and interactions \namong the various actors who take on multiple simultaneous and sequential roles \nin the context of family complexity.\n\nIdentities are the meanings that define individuals\u2014to themselves and oth-\ners\u2014in their social roles. Individuals are thought to prioritize the many identi-\nties they occupy, both simultaneously and over the course of their lives, \naccording to the degree of salience a particular identity has for them at a given \npoint in time and in a given social context. Individuals, then, function in multiple \nsystems of interactions that may require different types of agency. Concurrent \nactivation of multiple identities may engender identity role conflict (and related \nstress), both within and between individuals (Burke 1991; Burke and Stets \n2009).\n\nIdentities evolve as a result of social interactions and feedback that com-\npose an ongoing process through which individuals attempt to create shared \nmeaning vis-\u00e0-vis their social roles (Burke 1980, 2004; Burke and Stets 2009). \nIn the identity theory literature, this process is referred to as identity verifica-\ntion. It generally requires that \u201call the parties involved . . . work together to \ncreate a context in which they can verify each other\u2019s identities and have their \nown identity verified by the other\u2019s identity\u201d (Burke and Stets 2009, 152). As \nsuch, identity verification is both psychologically beneficial for individuals and \nalso promotes and strengthens group bonds (Burke and Stets 1999). In con-\ntrast, consistent failure to achieve identity verification is associated with ongo-\ning (dis)stress, anxiety, and internal conflict (Burke 1991, 1996, 2008). It is also \ninversely associated with self-esteem (self-efficacy/sense of competency, self-\nworth, and self-authenticity) (Cast and Burke 2002; Burke and Stets 1999). In \nresponse to identity conflicts, individuals may attempt to alleviate adverse \nemotions and achieve identity verification by altering their behaviors (Burke \n2006; Burke and Stets 2009; Cast and Burke 2002). If they are unable to do so, \nthey may abandon the identity-verification process, which may adversely influ-\nence their self-esteem and, in turn, their subsequent interactions and behav-\niors (Cast and Burke 2002; Burke and Stets 1999; Burke and harrod 2005). \nIdentity conflicts are particularly likely to arise as new identities are adopted. \nFurthermore, when multiple identities are enacted, verification of more sali-\nent identities will take precedence over verification of less salient identities \n(Stryker 1968).\n\n\n\nYOUNg ADULtS\u2019 ROLeS AS PARtNeRS AND PAReNtS 99\n\nKey implications of identity theory for adults\u2019 roles as  \npartners and parents\n\nBelow, we discuss four key implications of identity theory for adults\u2019 roles as \npartners and parents in the context of family complexity. throughout, we assume \nthat transitions through adolescence and adulthood are typically marked by a \nseries of dating relationships, some of which will eventually lead to cohabitation, \nmarriage, and/or fertility, potentially followed by additional family transitions \n(breakups and repartnerings) and ongoing fertility with the same or different \npartners.\n\nImplication 1: There is likely to be less identity conflict in noncomplex families \nand for individuals occupying only one family role than in complex families and \nfor individuals occupying multiple family roles. Identity conflict occurs when \nidentity-role meanings are incongruous within or between individuals. As such, \nfamily roles that are characterized by a clear set of obligations, responsibilities, \nand behavioral expectations should promote shared meaning among family mem-\nbers and induce less identity conflict than those that are ambiguously defined. \nthis applies both to consistency among the meanings that different family mem-\nbers attach to a particular family role, and also to consistency among the mean-\nings an individual attaches to the multiple family roles that she or he may \nsimultaneously occupy.\n\nwith regard to adults\u2019 roles as partners, the spousal role should engender \ngreater individual and shared meaning than the cohabiting partner role (although \nthis may be changing over time as cohabitation becomes more common and \n normative), whereas both the spousal and the cohabiting partner role should \nengender greater meaning than the dating partner role. the legal, social, and \npublic aspects (meanings) of marriage are well established; thus, expectations \nregarding spousal obligations, responsibilities, and behaviors tend to be widely \nshared and function to encourage an \u201cenforceable trust\u201d (Cherlin 2004) between \nhusband and wife. In contrast, cohabitation is less formally institutionalized; it is \ncharacterized by fewer normative and legal obligations and is less stable than \nmarriage (Nock 1995). this lack of institutionalization is even more characteristic \nof dating relationships. In short, the extent to which a particular type of relation-\nship is institutionalized\u2014 and, thereby, elicits mutual understanding and role \nexpectations\u2014is likely to be inversely associated with identity role conflict for the \nindividuals involved.\n\nturning to adults\u2019 roles as parents, identity conflict should be less common in \nnoncomplex families\u2014those in which both biological parents are present in the \nhousehold, are married to each other, and neither has children with another \npartner\u2014than in complex families. First, parental role salience (commitment to \nparenting) is likely to be stronger on average for biological parents than social \nparents, given both institutional norms and evolutionary interests (see Berger et \nal. 2008; Berger and Langton 2011; hofferth et al. 2013; Manning and Brown \n2013; Scott et al. 2013). Second, as discussed above, marital ties are more heavily \ninstitutionalized than cohabiting ties. third, marriage and child-rearing often \nrepresent a \u201cpackage deal,\u201d especially for men (townsend 2002). As such, spousal \n\n\n\n100 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nand parental roles\u2014and the role identities, expectations, and behaviors of both \nmothers and fathers\u2014are likely to correspond more closely in noncomplex fami-\nlies than in complex families, thereby reducing the likelihood of identity conflict \nin the former (Stets and Cast 2007).\n\nIn general, identity conflict should increase with family complexity due to a \ngreater likelihood of incongruity of role expectations. Conflict may occur, for \nexample, if a resident biological mother and nonresident biological father attrib-\nute different meanings and expectations to the nonresident-father role. It may \nalso occur if social parents and other family members, including children, attrib-\nute different meanings and expectations to the social-parent role. In addition, \nnonresident- and social-parent roles may engender less role salience than resi-\ndent- and biological-parent roles. Specifically, the biological parent identity may \nbe more salient than that of social parent; likewise, resident parents may experi-\nence greater identity salience with the parental role than nonresident parents.\n\nIdentity conflict may be particularly likely to occur among disadvantaged fami-\nlies\u2014which are disproportionately likely to be complex\u2014given that resource \nconstraints may pose barriers to meeting identity-role expectations. For example, \nto the extent that the identity associated with the (resident- or nonresident-, bio-\nlogical- or social-) father role encompasses that of breadwinner or economic \nprovider, disadvantaged men\u2019s struggles to provide economic support may \nimpede the identity verification process for these men and their (current or \nprior) partners and/or children. this, in turn, may adversely influence family \nfunctioning and relationships. At the same time, it is possible that identity roles \ndiffer for different population groups. For example, the extent to which the resi-\ndent- or nonresident-, biological- or social-father role is defined by breadwinning \nand/or direct child-rearing responsibilities (caregiving) may vary across popula-\ntion groups. If so, we might expect identity conflict associated with fulfillment of \nthe father role to vary accordingly. Additionally, the circumstances under which \nindividuals take on particular roles (such as \u201cparent\u201d) may vary by context. Burton \nand hardaway (2012), for example, describe how many low-income mothers act \nin parenting roles as \u201cother-mothers\u201d to their networks of family and kin, but are \nhesitant to act in a parenting capacity when it comes to their romantic partners\u2019 \nchildren with other women.\n\nAdult members of complex families frequently occupy multiple family roles, \nboth sequentially and simultaneously; this too may create opportunities for iden-\ntity conflict. Families that extend across households require resources (time and \nmoney) to be allocated among households (Baxter 2012). this may cause internal \nconflict in deciding how to parse out such resources, as well as external conflict \ndue to inconsistencies in the expectations of the individuals in each household. \nAs such, it should be more difficult to achieve shared meanings and expectations \nacross (multiple) family roles and, therefore, less likely that the range of individu-\nals composing a complex family will experience a sense of collective or shared \nidentity than would those composing a noncomplex family. Again, this may be \nparticularly true for families that face greater resource constraints.\n\nAn individual\u2019s commitment to a particular identity is dependent on the sali-\nence of the identity to his sense of self, the satisfaction he achieves by enacting \n\n\n\nYOUNg ADULtS\u2019 ROLeS AS PARtNeRS AND PAReNtS 101\n\nthe identity, and his appraisal of himself in the role (his self-assessment of his \nperformance in the role combined with his perception of how his performance is \nperceived by others). It is expressed through behaviors and resource investments \nthat are consistent with social norms for that role (Fox and Bruce 2001). \nCohabiting-partner, social-parent, and nonresident-parent roles likely inspire less \nrole salience than spousal, biological-parent, and resident-parent roles because \nthe former entail less clear norms.5 thus, individuals in complex families may \nexperience less role satisfaction and develop poorer appraisals of themselves in \ntheir family roles than those in noncomplex families. this may be especially true \nin a context of multiple-partner fertility in which there are even greater opportu-\nnities for incongruity in identity meanings. Fox and Bruce (2001, 396), for exam-\nple, describe the father identity as being \u201cone of varying salience, dependent on \nchoice and circumstance.\u201d In their empirical work, they hypothesize that the \nsalience of the father identity will be a key predictor of fathers\u2019 role performance; \nconsistent with this hypothesis, they find greater role salience, greater role satis-\nfaction, and positive self-appraisals of performance in the role to be associated \nwith higher-quality parenting attitudes and behaviors among biological fathers.\n\nthese ideas can be applied to adult roles as partners and parents more gener-\nally. that is, the salience of a particular partner or parent identity to an individual \nshould be positively associated with both the likelihood that the individual will \nexhibit ongoing behaviors that are consistent with that role and the satisfaction \nhe will achieve from successfully performing it. Such behaviors should, in turn, \nreduce ongoing identity conflict. In contrast, if an individual has difficulty enact-\ning a high-salience identity role, or encounters identity conflict with regard to \nthat role, he may experience considerable dissatisfaction and psychological dis-\ncomfort. In response, he might discontinue behaviors that are consistent with the \nidentity he associates with the role, or disengage from the role entirely. Such \nactions may pose a barrier to future identity verification. In a recent study of low-\nincome fathers, edin and Nelson (2013), for instance, describe how many of \nthese men experience considerable tension between wanting to forge a strong \nattachment to their (new) children and being unwilling or unable to meet the \nchildren\u2019s mothers\u2019 expectations for them as fathers and partners, which may \nresult in a range of negative consequences. Indeed, the authors conclude that \n\u201cwhen fathers are far more sure of their commitments to a child than to the \nmother of that child\u2014when they tell themselves, as they often do, that their \nrelationship with the child ought to have nothing to do with their relationship to \nthat child\u2019s mother\u2014they are even less willing to do what it takes to turn their \nlives around\u201d (p. 206).\n\nImplication 2: Transitions in family configuration necessitate changes in iden-\ntities and associated adjustments in identity roles. Identities vary in terms of \ntheir salience in a given situation and by the particular situations in which they \nare enacted (Stets and Cast 2007). As relationships and family configurations \nchange\u2014for example, as adults progress from dating to cohabitation or from \neither of these relationships to marriage; have a child together; or dissolve their \ndating, cohabiting, or marital relationship (within or outside of the context of \n\n\n\n102 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nparenthood)\u2014family members necessarily take on new role identities that they \nwill seek to verify. Identity conflicts may both lead to and result from family con-\nfiguration transitions (Stets and Cast 2007). For example, identity conflict vis-\u00e0-\nvis individuals\u2019 roles as partners and parents is associated with subsequent union \ndissolution (Cast and Burke 2002), which, in turn, requires enactment of new \nidentity roles, as the couple transitions out of its romantic relationship and each \nmember (potentially) repartners and/or experiences new-partner fertility. Union \ndissolution is particularly complicated when (joint biological) children are \ninvolved. In such situations, the mother and father must revise their parental \nidentities vis-\u00e0-vis one another and establish new roles with regard to their divi-\nsion of caregiving and decision-making responsibilities, as well as the provision of \nmaterial resources for the child(ren).\n\nBeyond requiring individuals to take on new family roles, transitions in family \nconfiguration are also likely to trigger changes in the salience of existing identi-\nties. For example, the birth of a child necessitates a transformation of both the \nmother\u2019s and father\u2019s roles as partners, as well as the initiation of their new roles \nas parents (Burke and Stets 2009; habib 2012). the salience of the parental \nidentity for each parent, the level of consistency between the parental identity \nand other identities (including that of partner or spouse and resident or nonresi-\ndent, biological or social parent to other children), and the level of consistency \nbetween their expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the parental identity are likely to affect how \nthe transition influences them individually and in relation to each other (habib \n2012). Additionally, having a child with a new partner may alter the salience of \n(commitment to) the nonresident parent identity with regard to a former child.\n\nImplication 3: Identity verification should be more difficult in complex families \nthan in noncomplex families. Individuals attempt to maintain and confirm their \nself-perceptions with regard to particular identity roles using strategies that may \nultimately encourage or discourage current or future identity verification (Stets \nand Cast 2007). For example, avoiding or expressing hostility toward an ex-part-\nner in response to identity conflict may inhibit future identity verification in the \nrole of nonresident coparent. It may also adversely influence identity verification \nwith nonresident children, particularly if it leads to decreased contact with them. \nOn the other hand, strategies such as revising one\u2019s identity meaning to be better \naligned with the ex-partner\u2019s expectations may aid identity verification in that \nparticular relationship. Doing so, however, may have implications for identity \nverification in other relationships, such as that with a current partner or spouse. \nto the extent that individuals inhabit multiple identities at the same time, the \nprobability of verifying all identities across all relationships becomes considerably \nsmaller. For example, a nonresident parent may downgrade his parental role vis-\n\u00e0-vis a nonresident child as a way of prioritizing his current partner and children, \nperhaps because he feels a stronger sense of membership in the current family \nunit than the prior one (it is unclear, however, whether this is likely to hold when \nthe current family unit includes only social children, as opposed to any biological \nchildren). these ideas are consistent with \u201cpackage deal,\u201d \u201ccompeting obligations,\u201d \nand \u201cresource dilution\u201d theories that have been applied to (particularly men\u2019s) \n\n\n\nYOUNg ADULtS\u2019 ROLeS AS PARtNeRS AND PAReNtS 103\n\nparenting in complex families (Scott et al. 2013; townsend 2002). Such a strategy \nmay decrease identity conflict and thereby increase the likelihood of identity \nverification in the new family unit. At the same time, it is likely to increase iden-\ntity conflict with the ex-partner and nonresident child(ren).\n\nBecause identity meanings and associated expectations are likely to be less \ncongruous among individuals in complex families than those in noncomplex fami-\nlies, the complexity of family configuration should be inversely associated with \nidentity verification. As such, individuals in complex families will likely experi-\nence less satisfaction in (at least some of) their family roles and, perhaps, poorer \nself-appraisals in those roles. Over time, this may manifest in behaviors that are \ninconsistent with social norms for the role, thus creating further conflict (Fox and \nBruce 2001) in an ongoing cycle. empirical research suggests, for example, that \nnew-partner fertility is associated with a shifting of investments from initial fami-\nlies to new families, as well as with decreased cooperative parenting between \nresident and nonresident parents (Berger, Cancian, and Meyer 2012; tach, \nMincy, and edin 2010). In turn, a parent\u2019s behavior toward her or his (nonresi-\ndent) children may heavily depend on the quality of the relationship with the \nother parent and the extent to which she or he is able to achieve mutual identity \nverification. existing evidence suggests that higher-quality relationships between \nresident and nonresident parents are associated with higher-quality parenting by \nnonresident parents (Carlson, McLanahan, and Brooks-gunn 2008).\n\nIdentity conflict may be particularly likely in the context of multiple-partner \nfertility, both because family membership is less well defined, and because the \nindividuals involved face competing demands from multiple family units. that is, \nfamily members are faced with the difficult task of balancing their commitment \nto a particular identity (e.g., resident biological father, nonresident biological \nfather, resident social father) with their commitment to a particular family unit or \nrelationship (e.g., current or prior family units; particular mothers and the bio-\nlogical or social, resident or nonresident children associated with them). this has \nthe potential to disrupt or prevent identity verification and, in some cases, indi-\nviduals may choose to de-prioritize or even give up particular identity roles. edin \nand Nelson (2013) use the term \u201cserial fatherhood\u201d to describe the process \nthrough which unwed fathers, who were unsuccessful in previous relationships \nwith their children\u2019s mothers and the children themselves, substitute relation-\nships with new partners (and children) as a means of coping with unsuccessful \npast attempts at being a \u201cgood\u201d father.\n\nImplication 4: Difficulty achieving identity verification implies that complex \nfamilies may exhibit greater psychological discomfort and poorer family function-\ning than may noncomplex families. Identity verification helps individuals to \u201cfeel \nunderstood and accepted in the[ir] relationship[s] . . . [which] should serve as an \nincentive for social actors to increase taking the role of the other\u201d or expressing \nempathy with others in their joint social roles (Stets and Cast 2007, 526). when \nidentity conflict occurs, individuals are likely to feel that they lack control over \ntheir social situations and thus experience low self-esteem and self-efficacy; such \npsychological discomfort may give way to negative emotional responses, including \n\n\n\n104 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nlack of empathy, increased aggressiveness, and controlling behaviors (Stets and \nBurke 2005a). empathy, trust, and being liked by one\u2019s spouse are positively \nassociated with identity verification within marriage (Stets and Cast 2007). Adults \nalso report better relationship quality and greater marital satisfaction when their \npartner or spouse reinforces their own self-perceptions (Burke and Stets 1999). \nIdentity conflict, on the other hand, is associated with poorer relationship quality \n(Stets and Burke 2005a); a greater probability of union dissolution (Cast and \nBurke 2002); less self-worth and self-efficacy; and more anger, depression, and \n(dis)stress (Stets and Burke 2005b).\n\nturning to adults\u2019 roles as parents, one\u2019s commitment to children is thought to \nbe a function of the salience of the parental role, the parent\u2019s sense of self, the \nsatisfaction the parent feels when activating that role, and the perception that \nothers view the parent as performing the role well. this implies that ongoing \ncommitment to the parental role is, at least in part, dependent on one\u2019s relation-\nship with the other parent and the extent to which family members are able to \nachieve (mutual) identity verification, whether or not the parents coreside (Fox \nand Bruce 2001). Prior research has found the transition to parenthood to be \nassociated with both positive and negative changes in adult mental health, self-\nconcept, self-esteem, stress, and anxiety (habib 2012). On average, child birth \ntends to have a negative influence on relationship satisfaction and the couple\u2019s \nrelationship quality; however, couples in higher-quality relationships and those \nthat were more satisfied with their relationship prior to the birth\u2014each of which \nimplies a greater degree of identity verification\u2014tend to experience smoother \ntransitions into parenthood than other couples (habib 2012). For fathers, \nresearch suggests that the perceived salience of the parental or \u201cfathering\u201d role, \nthe extent to which a father believes he is successfully fulfilling the role, and the \nquality of his relationship with the mother are all positively correlated with his \nbehaviors toward and involvement with children (habib 2012). A father\u2019s perfor-\nmance in these areas is, in turn, likely to influence the quality of his relationship \nwith the mother and the likelihood that they achieve ongoing identity \nverification.\n\nAdditionally, research by tsushima and Burke (1999) suggests that mothers \nwho fail to achieve identity verification in the parental role (those who, for exam-\nple, experience problems with behavioral control and have frequent confronta-\ntions with their children) may become frustrated and respond by distancing \nthemselves from their children and providing less adequate supervision and care. \nthis is particularly likely to occur among mothers who perceive the parental role \nas predominantly oriented toward behavioral control. engaging in less-effective \nparenting behaviors may, in turn, lead to further frustration and stress, and ulti-\nmately less self-efficacy and self-esteem in the parental role. In contrast, mothers \nwhose parental roles are guided by higher-level principles for child-rearing, rather \nthan behavioral control, tend to engage in more efficient parenting strategies \n(more role modeling and less disciplinary actions) and realize greater identity veri-\nfication in the parental role. they also tend to exhibit more empathy with their \nchildren, which may facilitate mutual identity verification and decrease parent-\nchild conflict and adverse emotions. this may lead to increased self-efficacy and \n\n\n\nYOUNg ADULtS\u2019 ROLeS AS PARtNeRS AND PAReNtS 105\n\nself-esteem for both children and parents (tsushima and Burke 1999). though \nnot tested by tsushima and Burke, these concepts may apply to fathers as well.\n\nIn sum, because identity verification is associated with psychological function-\ning, as well as ongoing behaviors and relationship quality, lower levels of identity \nverification in complex families are likely to be associated with poorer individual \nand family functioning. this may (adversely) influence future identity-role \nbehaviors and the well-being of both parents and children. Furthermore, \nalthough we are aware of no empirical research that explicitly tests this hypoth-\nesis, it is possible that difficulty achieving identity verification among individuals \n(e.g., resident and nonresident parents) in complex families may directly lead \nsome adults to distance themselves from their ex-partners and nonresident \nchildren.\n\nImplications for Future Research and Public Policy\n\nOur empirical work examined the frequency with which young adults in the \nNLSY 1979 and 1997 cohorts experienced a variety of family roles as partners \nand parents, as well as the extent to which they experienced these roles sequen-\ntially or simultaneously. we found that the complexity of adult family roles has \nincreased over time. By age 30, for example, approximately 8 percent of young \nadults in the 1979 cohort and 12 percent of the young adults in the 1997 cohort \nhad experienced at least two parental roles simultaneously in one or more survey \nyears. having had both resident and nonresident biological children as well as \nresident biological children and resident social children were the most common \ncombinations of parental roles that young adults experienced. the partner and \nparent roles taken on by these young adults ranged broadly, from single parent \nwith resident biological children to cohabiting parent with social children. In \npart, increases in family complexity over time may reflect differences in family \nformation patterns between cohorts. It is well known that the average age at first \nbirth has increased over time; likewise, the proportion of first births that occur \noutside of marriage (and particularly those occurring in the context of cohabita-\ntion) has also increased over time, particularly among less-advantaged individu-\nals. At the same time, however, our results indicate that there have been increases \n(of varying magnitude) over time in the proportion of young adults inhabiting \nmore than one parental role simultaneously, and this trend was present for all of \nthe racial groups we considered, and was especially large for respondents with \nhigh school diplomas or less education. Finally, although we found some evi-\ndence of greater relationship stability for couples in the 1997 cohort that had a \nfirst birth within the context of cohabitation (relative to marriage), as compared \nto those in the 1979 cohort who had a birth while cohabiting, cohabiting relation-\nships continue to be considerably more likely to dissolve than marriages.\n\nDespite these trends, most existing empirical work does not account for the \nfull range of partner and parental roles an adult may simultaneously occupy or \nmay have occupied over time, nor do most studies investigate how these \n\n\n\n106 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nexperiences may influence the individual\u2019s identity meaning, performance, and \nbehaviors in these roles. Studies tend to focus on a specific role (resident or non-\nresident biological parent, married or cohabiting social parent) an individual \noccupies with regard to a particular partner, child, or family unit. whereas exist-\ning work sometimes adjusts for whether an individual also occupies another role \n(often by controlling for whether she has children with another partner), few if \nany studies explicitly examine how a range of partner and parent behaviors may \nbe influenced by simultaneously engaging in multiple family roles within or \nacross family units. this area of analysis is ripe for inquiry.\n\nIn addition, we are aware of no study that empirically tests partner or parent \nidentity verification in the context of family complexity. given that identity verifica-\ntion may have important consequences for individual and family functioning, \nfuture research would be well served by taking this on. Future work should exam-\nine whether and how multiple sequential and simultaneous family roles may be \nassociated with identity verification and, more broadly, family relationships and \nparental behaviors. It should also address whether there are subgroups of the \npopulation that are more (and less) likely to struggle with identity verification in the \ncontext of family complexity, as well as whether specific family configurations and \nroles are particularly subject to identity-role conflict and problems with identity \nverification. Finally, future research should explicitly examine associations between \nidentity verification and adult, child, and family functioning and well-being. For \ninstance, future work should investigate whether lack of identity verification (and \nassociated conflict) helps to explain why cohabiting relationships are less stable \nthan marriages, and why subsequent marriages are more likely to dissolve than \ninitial marriages (Bramlett and Mosher 2002). It should also examine whether \nidentity conflict and verification problems are associated with parenting behaviors \nand satisfaction with interpersonal interactions across family configurations.\n\nOur work also suggests that family policies must now balance a wide range of \nactors, roles, and relationships within and across families. It is unrealistic for poli-\ncies to focus primarily on (coresident and non-coresident) biological parents and \ntheir joint child(ren). Our application of identity theory to family complexity sug-\ngests that families may be less likely to function\u2014economically and socially\u2014as \ncohesive units than has been the case in the past, and than most existing policies \nassume. this finding implies that there should be a substantial shift in how poli-\ncies approach families and family functioning, as well as familial roles, obliga-\ntions, and responsibilities. It is relevant to any policy that links eligibility or \nbenefit levels to family unit membership. given high rates of cohabitation, for \nexample, the role of domestic partner benefits and common law marriage policies \nmay become increasingly important for both same- and different-sex couples \nwith and without children. Pension and survivors\u2019 benefits are generally only \navailable to married spouses and widow(er)s. Likewise, cohabiting partners are \nunlikely to receive spousal support after a breakup (although there are some \nexceptions). In addition, parental leave and health care coverage in the United \nStates, particularly when employer provided, often do not apply to a cohabiting \npartner\u2019s children. even with the implementation of mandated health care cover-\nage, questions remain as to which parent\u2019s policy should (or must) cover which \n\n\n\nYOUNg ADULtS\u2019 ROLeS AS PARtNeRS AND PAReNtS 107\n\nchildren, and this may vary by coresident, marital, and biological status. Likewise, \ntax credits, cash transfers, food and nutrition programs, and child support policies \nmust all grapple with family complexity and multiple-partner fertility, a weighty \ntask given that these programs were designed for simpler family configurations, \nwhich were assumed to be relatively static (rather than fluid). As such, child-\nconditioned benefits must often be assigned to one particular family unit or \nhousehold such that frequently children can only be \u201cclaimed\u201d in one household, \nregardless of their actual living situation or time spent in various households.\n\nthe children associated with complex families tend to be socioeconomically \ndisadvantaged, and the inverse relation between socioeconomic disadvantage and \nchild well-being is well established (Duncan and Brooks-gunn 1997; Mayer \n1997). to the extent that family complexity is also associated with less effective \nparenting, as well as lower levels of parental well-being\u2014potentially due to iden-\ntity verification problems\u2014we may expect adverse effects on child well-being to \nbe exacerbated. this, too, has implications for ongoing intergenerational trans-\nfers of parenting behaviors and social inequality, and for potential policy efforts \nto improve child outcomes in economically disadvantaged families.\n\nIn short, policy must grapple with different patterns of biological, marital, and \ncoresidential ties, as well as with which types of ties to privilege in what circum-\nstances. It must also consider the needs, capabilities, and well-being of biological, \nsocial, resident, and nonresident parents and the children with whom they are \nassociated. Furthermore, it must account for the fact that these relationships are \n(increasingly) fluid over time and that individuals are (increasingly) likely to \noccupy more than one of these roles simultaneously. Many existing policies are \ntargeted at particular categories of families. Yet high rates of complexity make it \ndifficult to categorize families and to develop appropriate policies for promoting \nchild and family well-being. Policy must also balance conflicting principles and \ninevitable trade-offs on issues of equity, adequacy, affordability, and outcomes \nfrom multiple perspectives, as well as simplicity of implementation and adminis-\ntration versus the ability to tailor to the specific needs associated with (evolving) \nfamily configurations. Increasing family complexity also has implications for the \nadministrative capacity and feasibility of policy and program implementation and \nongoing operation across a range of policy domains (see Meyer and Carlson, this \nvolume).\n\nNotes\n\n1. we began our analyses at age 17 because this was when the relevant measures (particu-\nlarly in the 1997 cohort) began to be collected for all respondents.\n\n2. the variables used to measure nonresident children were slightly different across the two \ncohorts. For the 1979 cohort, respondents reported where each biological child \u201cusually\u201d \nresided, and those who usually resided outside the respondent\u2019s household (with the exception \nof those away at school) were considered nonresident. For the 1997 cohort, we used a precon-\nstructed measure of the number of nonresident biological children the respondent had at each \nsurvey wave. the handling of adopted children also differs across surveys. In 1997, adopted \nchildren are categorized with biological children. In the 1979 cohort, however, adopted  \n\n\n\n108 the ANNALS OF the AMeRICAN ACADeMY\n\nchildren are indistinguishable from stepchildren. this may make a difference for the segment \nof the adopted population of children that were adopted by both, rather than one, of their \nparents. In addition, because information about biological children\u2019s usual place of residence \nwas not available between 1979 and 1981 or in the 1983 survey, we exclude those interview \nyears from our analyses.\n\n3. For the 1979 cohort, data were available about the highest degree obtained for all survey \nyears beginning with 1988. For the years prior to that, we base our measure of education on \nthe total number of years of school completed, with <12 years coded as no high school, 12 years \nconsidered a high school diploma/geD, 13\u201315 years coded as a \u201csome college\u201d, and 16 or \nmore years coded as a bachelor\u2019s degree or more. Note that the recoding based on years of \neducation was only relevant for the relatively few respondents who did not have more recent \neducation information available from the 1988 and later survey years.\n\n4. Note that our analyses estimate the number of types of roles young adults inhabit. An \nindividual who has nonresident children from two relationships, for example, would be \ncounted as experiencing multiple roles if he also had resident biological or resident social \nchildren. In contrast, if he had only nonresident biological children, he would not be counted \nas experiencing multiple roles, even if he had nonresident children with multiple partners. In \nthis way, we underestimate the level of complexity experienced by the young adults in the \nsample.\n\n5. As these roles become more common, however, new norms and related role expectations \nmay evolve and change. thus, it is possible that the degree of identity conflict associated with \nparticular sequential or simultaneous roles may change over time, or vary between subgroups \nof the population in which particular family configurations are more or less common.\n\nReferences\n\nBaxter, Jennifer A. 2012.
