Matondi. Uppsala,\nLondon, and New York, NY: Nordic Africa Institute and Zed Books, 2012. xvii +\n286 pp. \u00a321.99/$39.95 (paperback) ISBN 978 1 78032 148 6.\n\nThere is no question that the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP),\nwhich began in 2000, has transformed the agrarian structure of Zimbabwe radically.\nThe question, or sets of questions, at the centre of this debate now focus on how the\nFTLRP has played out, and how it continues to unfold, at the local level. These two\nrelatively new additions to the literature offer the reader a chance to further explore\nthis set of hotly debated issues.\n\nZimbabwe Takes Back Its Land aims to uncover \u2018the reality on the ground in\n2012\u2019 (p. 13), and is \u2018about the new farmers\u2026 about their successes and failures\u2019\n(pp. 14\u201315). The first five chapters look at colonialism and the first two decades of\nindependence; chapters 6 to 9 cover the FTLRP and the situation in 2012; and the\nremaining chapters discuss unresolved issues, including women\u2019s land rights\n(Chapter 10), environmental concerns (Chapter 11), farm labour, irrigation, and\ntenure security (Chapter 12). The authors assert that new farmers have been \u2018success-\nful\u2019; that they are more productive than the former white farmers; that productivity\ncontinues to rise; and that living standards are improving. The book is described as a\n\u2018comprehensive\u2019 and \u2018balanced\u2019 account of Zimbabwe\u2019s FTLRP, \u2018written with jour-\nnalistic passion and scholarly rigour\u2019 (back cover). However, it is problematic in a\nnumber of ways.\n\nThe title itself is misleading, implying a single Zimbabwean identity, ignoring wider\nquestions of citizenship, identity, and belonging. After all, many \u2018Zimbabweans\u2019 failed\nto benefit from the FTLRP, including many farmworkers, youths, women, the dis-\nabled, and even war veterans. These \u2018losers\u2019 do not fit the narrative, so they are largely\nignored. The title and narrative also obscure the many conflicts that took place, and\ncontinue to play out, at the local and national level, which extend beyond simple di-\nchotomies of black versus white, or colonial versus post-colonial. This broad-brush\napproach extends to the authors\u2019 treatment of Zimbabwean history, and specifically\nthe history of land, which at times reflects the narrow and exclusive \u2018patriotic history\u2019\npropagated by ZANU-PF since 2000/1.\n\nHanlon et al. also tend to misrepresent opposing arguments. On elite land-\ngrabbing, they write: \u2018If we are to object to big farms being held by an elite, it means\nobjecting to the whole system of having A2 and large-scale farms, because only an elite\ncan afford the investment\u2019 (p. 90). This is a deliberate oversimplification of the \u2018crony\u2019\nargument \u2013 a straw man. They offer no solid data to support the argument that it was\nlargely the poor and landless who benefited. Instead, they write: \u2018Undoubtedly some\n[beneficiaries] are political elites \u2026 which we guess to be 5 per cent of farmers and 10\nper cent of land\u2019 (p. 99, my emphasis).\n\nThe six criteria for \u2018success\u2019 (pp.112\u201314) are obvious. The fact that farming\nrequires capital, knowledge, investment, and hard work is far from ground-breaking.\nThe authors correctly state that \u2018there is no single measure of \u201csuccess\u201d\u2019 (p. 118), so\nthey also present income and production data. While these conventional measures\n\n312 AFRICANAFFAIRS\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n https://academ\n\nic.oup.com\n/afraf/article/113/451/312/135442 by Library user on 22 July 2021\n\n\n\nare important, they are narrow and limited, ignoring local perceptions of \u2018success\u2019\nand \u2018failure\u2019, \u2018wealth\u2019 and \u2018poverty\u2019. Rural households seek to create livelihood port-\nfolios, and total household income is often a mixture of agricultural production, em-\nployment, remittances, and natural resource utilization. This complexity is not\ncaptured by crop production and income statistics alone, especially when they too\nare incomplete (there is absolutely no mention of livestock sales or production, for\nexample).\n\nFurthermore, the authors\u2019 data fail to account for seasonal cycles in rural liveli-\nhoods. They attempt to plot livelihood trajectories, concluding that: \u2018On average,\nthe fast track farmers are doing well\u2026 and over the next decade can be expected to\ncontinue growing\u2019 (p. 210). Their data do not allow them to generalize in this way,\nand predictions of continued growth are purely speculative. There is simply not\nenough of a longitudinal perspective to substantiate these claims \u2013 this can only be\nachieved by revisiting the same farmers over an extended period.\n\nThe primary weakness of the book, therefore, is its flawed methodology. The\nauthors extrapolate from a sample of 102 farmers situated in Mazowe district on\n\u2018some of the richest farmland\u2019 in Zimbabwe (p. 122). There is no description of the\nsampling process, and no explanation for the decision to \u2018survey\u2019 these specific\nfarms. The result is a series of hasty generalizations based on limited data taken\nfrom an unrepresentative sample, with some selective evidence from other studies\nused to fill the gaps. This includes uncritical use of \u2018official\u2019 statistics that are notori-\nously unreliable (for example, the rainfall statistics on pp. 50\u20131).\n\nThe book\u2019s only strength lies in its attempt to give a voice to the beneficiaries\nthemselves, who are often drowned out in a debate that has tended to be pitched at\nthe national level. However, even these personal narratives are limited because, as\nthe authors themselves concede, \u2018a handful of examples, good or bad, proves\nnothing\u2019 (p. 112).\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s Fast Track Land Reform, on the other hand, is altogether more reward-\ning. Matondi also aims \u2018to show what happened on the ground\u2019 (p. 2), but his ana-\nlysis is more comprehensive and nuanced, benefiting from ten years of collaborative\nfield-based research. Chapters 1 to 3 draw an important distinction between land\noccupations, acquisitions, and subsequent allocations. These are often treated as\none, but they are distinct, with their own sets of questions, which Matondi tackles\nwithout the ideological biases that taint other studies. Overall, he argues that \u2018there\nis no question that the land transfers have provided the majority of people with new\nopportunities\u2019 (p. 236), but that \u2018challenges have limited the realisation of the full\npotential of the land taken\u2019 (p. 237). These challenges include tenure security\n(Chapter 4), agricultural productivity (Chapter 5), access to services (Chapter 6),\nwomen\u2019s land rights (Chapter 7), and social organization (Chapter 8).\n\nMatondi is at his best when writing about tenure security. He successfully\ncaptures the ongoing conflicts and remaining uncertainties of land ownership, and\nargues that unresolved issues are preventing farmers from \u2018getting on with the busi-\nness of farming\u2019 (p. 128). The fact that some farmers are simulating land use to\navoid repossession by the state has been missed elsewhere, which illustrates\nMatondi\u2019s ability to uncover not only farmers\u2019 insecurities but also the more\nobscure aspects of resettlement.\n\nBOOK REVIEWS 313\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n https://academ\n\nic.oup.com\n/afraf/article/113/451/312/135442 by Library user on 22 July 2021\n\n\n\nMany of Matondi\u2019s findings directly contradict those of Hanlon et al. On agricul-\ntural production, Matondi argues that despite recent improvements most crops fall\nshort of potential output. Surprisingly, however, he pays little attention to tobacco,\nwhich has become an important cash crop for many smallholders. On gender,\nHanlon et al. write that \u2018women have benefited significantly from the Fast Track\nLand Reform\u2019 (p. 171), but Matondi describes the FTLRP as a \u2018lost opportunity\u2019\nfor women (p. 207). There are some successful women farmers, but many are strug-\ngling because they lack inputs, credit, and markets, and women are particularly vul-\nnerable.\n\nMatondi\u2019s methods (household surveys, focus groups, etc.) are also more robust,\nengaging directly with farmers in three districts \u2013 Mazowe, Shamva, and Mangwe \u2013\nenabling him to show how experiences of the FTLRP vary between sites of different\nagricultural potential, and how differences in local politics shape resettlement.\nSome chapters are based on data from Mazowe only, but Matondi is generally more\ncautious in his conclusions than Hanlon et al.\n\nIn short, readers looking for a well-informed, comprehensive, measured and\nevidence-based analysis of the FTLRP should opt for Zimbabwe\u2019s Fast Track Land\nReform.\n\nCentre of African Studies, University of Edinburgh GARETH D.

London and New York, NY: Zed Books in association\nwith the International African Institute, Royal African Association and World Peace\nFoundation, 2013. x + 238 pp. \u00a312.99 (paperback). ISBN 978 1 78032 420 3.\n\nLorenzo Cotula\u2019s book provides a great summary of the recent literature on land\ngrabbing in Africa, lightened up with colourful and detailed case studies from his\nown research across a range of African countries. The picture he paints of land grab-\nbing in Africa is a complex one, shaped by its historical antecedents and driven by\nnational and international interests and actors alike. However, Cotula manages to\nbreak down complexity, intersect it, and analyse it in a way that is both interesting\nand highly informative.\n\nThroughout the book Cotula makes an effort to challenge a range of commonly\nheld assumptions about the drivers, the extent, and the impacts of land grabbing in\nAfrica. One of his recurring arguments concerns the often neglected \u2018historicity\u2019 of\ncurrent land deals. While land grabbing is often discussed in an ahistorical way,\nCotula argues that \u2018the commoditization of land has been going on for a very long\ntime, and the land rush merely constitutes an acceleration of that process\u2019 (p. 177).\nIn line with other authors published in this journal (see Pauline Peters, 112, 449,\nOctober 2113), he reminds us that only by looking back at colonialism and land\nacquisitions made after colonialism can we possibly understand today\u2019s land rush\nand the impact it is having on the continent. By designating vast tracts of land as\nvacant and vesting them in the state, devaluing customary rights to land as mere \u2018use\n\n314 AFRICANAFFAIRS\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n https://academ\n\nic.oup.com\n/afraf/article/113/451/312/135442 by Library user on 22 July 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<<\n  /ASCII85EncodePages false\n  /AllowTransparency false\n  /AutoPositionEPSFiles true\n  /AutoRotatePages /PageByPage\n  /Binding /Left\n  /CalGrayProfile ()\n  /CalRGBProfile (sRGB IEC61966-2.1)\n  /CalCMYKProfile (U.S. Web Coated \\050SWOP\\051 v2)\n  /sRGBProfile (sRGB IEC61966-2.1)\n  /CannotEmbedFontPolicy /Warning\n  /CompatibilityLevel 1.5\n  /CompressObjects /Off\n  /CompressPages true\n  /ConvertImagesToIndexed true\n  /PassThroughJPEGImages false\n  /CreateJDFFile false\n  /CreateJobTicket false\n  /DefaultRenderingIntent /Default\n  /DetectBlends true\n  /DetectCurves 0.1000\n  /ColorConversionStrategy /LeaveColorUnchanged\n  /DoThumbnails false\n  /EmbedAllFonts true\n  /EmbedOpenType false\n  /ParseICCProfilesInComments true\n  /EmbedJobOptions true\n  /DSCReportingLevel 0\n  /EmitDSCWarnings false\n  /EndPage -1\n  /ImageMemory 524288\n  /LockDistillerParams false\n  /MaxSubsetPct 100\n  /Optimize true\n  /OPM 1\n  /ParseDSCComments true\n  /ParseDSCCommentsForDocInfo false\n  /PreserveCopyPage true\n  /PreserveDICMYKValues true\n  /PreserveEPSInfo true\n  /PreserveFlatness true\n  /PreserveHalftoneInfo false\n  /PreserveOPIComments true\n  /PreserveOverprintSettings false\n  /StartPage 1\n  /SubsetFonts true\n  /TransferFunctionInfo /Preserve\n  /UCRandBGInfo /Remove\n  /UsePrologue false\n  /ColorSettingsFile ()\n  /AlwaysEmbed [ true\n  ]\n  /NeverEmbed [ true\n    /Courier\n    /Courier-Bold\n    /Courier-BoldOblique\n    /Courier-Oblique\n    /Helvetica\n    /Helvetica-Bold\n    /Helvetica-BoldOblique\n    /Helvetica-Oblique\n    /Symbol\n    /Times-Bold\n    /Times-BoldItalic\n    /Times-Italic\n    /Times-Roman\n    /ZapfDingbats\n  ]\n  /AntiAliasColorImages false\n  /CropColorImages true\n  /ColorImageMinResolution 150\n  /ColorImageMinResolutionPolicy /OK\n  /DownsampleColorImages true\n  /ColorImageDownsampleType /Bicubic\n  /ColorImageResolution 175\n  /ColorImageDepth -1\n  /ColorImageMinDownsampleDepth 1\n  /ColorImageDownsampleThreshold 1.50286\n  /EncodeColorImages true\n  /ColorImageFilter /DCTEncode\n  /AutoFilterColorImages false\n  /ColorImageAutoFilterStrategy /JPEG2000\n  /ColorACSImageDict <<\n    /QFactor 0.40\n    /HSamples [1 1 1 1] /VSamples [1 1 1 1]\n  >>\n  /ColorImageDict <<\n    /QFactor 0.40\n    /HSamples [1 1 1 1] /VSamples [1 1 1 1]\n  >>\n  /JPEG2000ColorACSImageDict <<\n    /TileWidth 256\n    /TileHeight 256\n    /Quality 20\n  >>\n  /JPEG2000ColorImageDict <<\n    /TileWidth 256\n    /TileHeight 256\n    /Quality 15\n  >>\n  /AntiAliasGrayImages false\n  /CropGrayImages true\n  /GrayImageMinResolution 150\n  /GrayImageMinResolutionPolicy /OK\n  /DownsampleGrayImages true\n  /GrayImageDownsampleType /Bicubic\n  /GrayImageResolution 175\n  /GrayImageDepth -1\n  /GrayImageMinDownsampleDepth 2\n  /GrayImageDownsampleThreshold 1.50286\n  /EncodeGrayImages true\n  /GrayImageFilter /DCTEncode\n  /AutoFilterGrayImages false\n  /GrayImageAutoFilterStrategy /JPEG2000\n  /GrayACSImageDict <<\n    /QFactor 0.40\n    /HSamples [1 1 1 1] /VSamples [1 1 1 1]\n  >>\n  /GrayImageDict <<\n    /QFactor 0.40\n    /HSamples [1 1 1 1] /VSamples [1 1 1 1]\n  >>\n  /JPEG2000GrayACSImageDict <<\n    /TileWidth 256\n    /TileHeight 256\n    /Quality 20\n  >>\n  /JPEG2000GrayImageDict <<\n    /TileWidth 256\n    /TileHeight 256\n    /Quality 15\n  >>\n  /AntiAliasMonoImages true\n  /CropMonoImages true\n  /MonoImageMinResolution 1200\n  /MonoImageMinResolutionPolicy /OK\n  /DownsampleMonoImages true\n  /MonoImageDownsampleType /Bicubic\n  /MonoImageResolution 175\n  /MonoImageDepth 4\n  /MonoImageDownsampleThreshold 1.50286\n  /EncodeMonoImages true\n  /MonoImageFilter /CCITTFaxEncode\n  /MonoImageDict <<\n    /K -1\n  >>\n  /AllowPSXObjects true\n  /CheckCompliance [\n    /None\n  ]\n  /PDFX1aCheck false\n  /PDFX3Check false\n  /PDFXCompliantPDFOnly false\n  /PDFXNoTrimBoxError true\n  /PDFXTrimBoxToMediaBoxOffset [\n    0.00000\n    0.00000\n    0.00000\n    0.00000\n  ]\n  /PDFXSetBleedBoxToMediaBox true\n  /PDFXBleedBoxToTrimBoxOffset [\n    0.00000\n    0.00000\n    0.00000\n    0.00000\n  ]\n  /PDFXOutputIntentProfile (None)\n  /PDFXOutputConditionIdentifier ()\n  /PDFXOutputCondition ()\n  /PDFXRegistryName ()\n  /PDFXTrapped /False\n\n  /Description <<\n    /ENU ()\n  >>\n>> setdistillerparams\n<<\n  /HWResolution [600 600]\n  /PageSize [612.000 792.000]\n>> setpagedevice\n\n"}
