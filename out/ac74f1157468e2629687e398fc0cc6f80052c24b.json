Mahedi Hasan2, Sokvibol Kea 1,\nand Nazir Muhammad Abdullahi 1\n\n1College of Economics and Management, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China;\n2Faculty of Business Studies, Bangladesh University of Professional, Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\nABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to explore the nature and role of the Youth Skill Development Loans\n(YSDL) in the generation of livelihoods activities for the youth community of Bangladesh under theWomen\u2019s\nEmpowerment and Livelihood Development \u201cNuton Jibon\u201d. The study is significant for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, our literature review shows a dearth of research on the youth beneficiaries of the project. Second, there\nis a \u2018youth bulge\u2019 in Bangladesh, a developing economy experiencing the demographic dividend. The default\nissue in the YSDL is largely ignored. We have, therefore, examined the YSDL utilization status of 105 youths\nby using the logit model. The results reveal that the size of the loan, due amount of payment and education are\nsignificant factors to determine whether the youth would be a loan defaulter or regular payer. In essence, it is\nvital to enhance the overall capacities and skills of the rural youths.\n\nKEY WORDS: Bangladesh, Community- Driven Development Approach (CDD), good governance, micro-\nfinance, rural development, rural youths, Social Development Foundation (SDF), sustainable livelihoods\nframework, women\u2019s empowerment, Youth Skill Development Loans (YSDL)\n\nJEL: G 21, O12, O16, O 18\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of the Youth Skill Development Loans (YSDL)\nin the generation of livelihoods activities for the youth community of Bangladesh under the\nWomen\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood Development \u201cNuton Jibon\u201d Project, financed by the\nWorld Bank and the government of Bangladesh. Established in 2000 as an autonomous and \u2018not-\nfor-profit\u2019 organization by the government of Bangladesh, under the Ministry of Finance, Social\nDevelopment Foundation (SDF) has grown to become one of the 25 most successful successful\norganizations of Bangladesh in poverty alleviation (Social Development Foundation, Annual Report\n2013). This paper offers a case study of the works of the SDF. The success of microfinance in\nmeeting the welfare needs of the poor across the globe has been documented elsewhere (Islam\net al. 2016; Mia et al. 2017). Bangladesh\u2019s Social Investment Program Project (SIPP) is\na government-led initiative funded by the World Bank. The SDF has conceptualized the program\nto address the extreme poverty as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of the\ngovernment of Bangladesh. SDF started implementing SIPP in Bangladesh in 2013, with the use of\nCommunity-Driven Development Approach (CDD). The program has been implemented with\na holistic development approach geared towards inclusion using tools like the community finance,\nlivelihood improvement, youth employment, infrastructure development, and women empowerment.\nIn capturing the holistic aspects of rural development and livelihood activities, the Women\u2019s\nEmpowerment and Livelihood Development \u201cNuton Jibon\u201d Project is a very special project.\n\nThe main focus of this study is on the Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement project that was\nimplemented in 3262 villages of 16 most vulnerable districts and 657,593 households.

The objective was to improve the livelihoods of extreme poor communities\nand to strengthen community institutions in the selected districts of Bangladesh. The project was\nimplemented in a total of 16 districts covering six divisions \u2013 Dhaka, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna,\nBarisal and Sylhet that included 51 Upazilas (sub-districts), 266 Unions, and 3262 villages (See, the\nSupplementary Material Table S1 & Table S2 available online).\n\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there exists no study with regard to the youth beneficiaries of\nthe project. This work will provide important insights into the roles of SDF in establishing the norms of\ngood governance in Bangladesh. The project is composed of several components such as microfinance,\nyouth development, environmental hazard management, training, and institutional capacity building.\nFor brevity of this paper, we will focus on the youth skill development loan utilization aspects of this\nproject component \u2013 youth and development. The YSDL is conducive to employment generations,\ncapacity buildings, and improvements in the decision making of the rural poor youth.\n\nThe reminder of the paper is organized into several segments. The review of the literature is\nprovided in section 2. The next section 3 elucidates the theoretical framework and the key project\nprinciples. The data sources and methods are explained in section 4. The results and discussions are\npresented in section 5 before conclusions are finally offered.\n\n1. Literature Review\n\nThe Community Operational Manual (COM) is comprised of the 15 Booklets to guide and help local/\ngrassroots level implementation and management of the project. Voluminous works are produced with\nrespect to the microfinance operations across the globe. There are, however, a few studies that analyzed\nthe lending strategies of the youth related to the microfinance institutions. Our present study covers the\ninstitutional performance of the SDF and assess the vulnerability of the youth group who utilized loan\nfrom the above-mentioned project implemented by SDF, Bangladesh. Most of the studies on micro-\nfinance repayment behavior are focused on group lending system. Our study is also based on group\nlending system but the groups are homogenous in nature as all people are young. In the next section, we\nwill briefly review some studies which were carried on the same research theme.\n\nM. Godquin (2004), used 1,629 loan observations to analyze the performance of microfinance\ninstitutions to check the repayment status. The study was based on group lending, and the result\nshowed that strong social ties have a negative impact on repayment behavior.\n\nSharma and Zeller (1997) examined group-based lending programs in Bangladesh. They used data\nfor 128 groups from four programs. In that study, they found that where there are more relatives in\nthe group create more default rate. It means when peoples are very much known to each other, they\nmay feel less pressure to repay the loan.\n\nBassem (2008), explored that the group lending is successful in Tunisia. The results of the\nestimation of that study showed that, the internal rule of conduct, business type, peer pressure,\nknowledge about other members of the group, sex, education and non-financial services has an\ninfluence on repayment. The also explored, marital status and homogeneity affect negative where\u2019s\nthe tie with the loan officer affect positively the repayment performance.\n\nFikirte (2011) in his study used t-test and chi-square analysis to compare the defaulters and non-\ndefaulters\u2019 group. In that study, a binary logit model also was used to analyze the socio-economic\nfactors that influence loan repayment.\n\nNawai and Sharif (2012) carried out a study in Malaysia on 309 respondents where they used\nmultinomial logit regression model to analyze the factors affecting repayment performance and found\nthat gender, formal religious education, distance to the lender office, business formality, total sales\nper month, total loan received, loan monitoring and loan disbursement lag have significantly affected\nborrower\u2019s repayment performance.\n\n2530 S. SHAHRIAR ET AL.\n\n\n\nWongnaa, Awunyo-Vitor (2013) analyzed the critical factors that affect the loan repayment\nperformance of yam farmers in the Sene district of Ghana on 100 respondents. The researcher used\nprobit model and the result showed that education, experience, profit, age, supervision, and off-farm\nincome have positive effects on loan repayment performance whereas gender and marriage have\nnegative effects on loan repayment while the effect of household size was found to be ambiguous.\n\nAssfaw, Desta and Bahita (2015) examined group loan repayment rate in Mekelle where they found an\nincreasing rate of default participants causes a decreased number of microfinance institutions. The study has\napplied a binary logistic regression model to analyze the factors influencing group loan repayment\nperformance.\n\nShahriar (2015) studied SDF\u2019s Women\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement Nuton Jibon\nproject from the empowerment approach by analyzing data collected from the two northern villages\nof the district of Rangpur, Bangladesh. The study reported the well functioning of the village\ninstitutions and found the positive role of the project in developing rural leadership, employment\nopportunities of the poor and the hard-core poor. The researcher suggested to enhance the levels of\ncoordination and balances among the village institutions and various project activities.\n\nCorsi and Angelis (2016) reported gender discrimination in microfinance operations in the context\nof the evidence from Uganda. In a recent study on 619 microfinance institutions from 75 countries,\nseveral researchers conclude that government ideology is an important determinant of the perfor-\nmance of micro-finance (Gul, Podder, and Shahriar 2017).\n\nMallick and Nabin (2018) assesses the trade-off between poverty alleviation and cost-effectiveness\nencountered by NGOs by investing the factors determining the program location choice of NGOs in\nBangladesh. The results suggest that cost-effectiveness and loan repayment concerns serve as barriers\nto reaching the poor. They also suggest the inability of the microfinance program to mitigate credit\nmarket imperfections in the presence of output market imperfections, and this implication can be\ngeneralized for the microfinance industry worldwide.\n\nUsing a nationally representative sample, Murshid and Ball (2018) have found a positive association\nship between women\u2019s physical mobility and microfinance participation in Bangladesh. The paper also\nhighlights the contradiction between the proliferation of empowerment programs and patriarchal social,\ncultural, and infrastructural barriers that prevent women from accessing such programs.\n\nUsing nationally representative survey data from rural Bangladesh, Sraboni (2018) examine the\nrelationship between women\u2019s empowerment in agriculture and indicators of individual dietary\nquality. They have found that women\u2019s empowerment is positively and significantly associated\nwith men\u2019s and women\u2019s dietary diversity and nutrient intakes.\n\nDatta and Banerjee (2018) have focused on the entrepreneurial initiatives among rural women\nborrowers in Bangladesh. They conclude that micro-finance users primarily concentrate on\nexpanding existing business and consumption expenditure, rather than taking extra risk to usher\nin searching, planning, and bricolage for a new venture. The study has shown how the micro-\nfinance contributes to the improvement of the women\u2019s living conditions and the reduction of\ntheir consumption poverty.\n\nWe are motivated to undertake this study for a couple of reasons. First, reviewed studies show\na knowledge deficiency regarding Bangladesh\u2019s YSDL. Second, 170 million people live in 14.4 million\nhectares of land in Bangladesh. It is one of themost densely populated countries in theworldwith a total area\nof 147,570 square kilometers, a population density of 1062.5 per square kilometer and total cultivable land of\n8.29 million hectares. Furthermore, there is an increase in the working age population. The presence of\na relatively high percentage of young people is a reflection of a new reality in Bangladesh \u2013 a lower middle-\nincome country with \u2018demographic dividend\u2019 (Islam 2016). There has been a \u2018youth bulge\u2019 in Bangladesh.\nThe micro-financial issues in relations to the youth are, however, largely ignored in the existing literature.\nThis paper intends to fill the research gap.\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE YOUTH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LOANS IN BANGLADESH 2531\n\n\n\n2. Theoretical Framework and Project Principles\n\n2.1. CDD Approach\n\nThe project was based on the Community-Driven Development (CDD) Approach. The CDD is,\naccording to the World Bank, viewed as \u2018one way of achieving social and economic empower-\nment and inclusion and reducing vulnerability. It is a mechanism that can be used to enhance\nlivelihood development and increase community control over resources and decision-making\nwhile developing their capacity to reach out to markets and services and manage risks\u2019 (World\nBank 2010, p.33).\n\n2.2. Good Governance\n\nGood governance is a widely used concept in the development literature. It is the manner in which\npower is exercised in the management of a country\u2019s economic and social resources for development\n(World Bank, 1992).\n\n\u25cf Inclusion: All project activities will ensure that extreme poor, poor, most vulnerable, disabled,\ndestitute, women and youth are targeted and included in project support; At least 90% of the extreme\npoor and 70%of the poor identified in the villages will be direct beneficiaries of the Village\nDevelopment Fund (VDF) envelope. \u2018Nuton Jibon Groups\u2019(NJS) are consisted of the project\nbeneficiaries and the Village Credit Organizations (VCO) are empowered to run the \u2018Swabalambi\nLoan\u2019 activities. The project is based on the following principles of good governance.\n\n\u25cf Equity: All decision-making positions in all the village institutions such as Gram Samiti, Social\nAudit Committee (SAC), and subcommittees of the Gram Samiti will be occupied by extreme\npoor, poor, women and youth. The following Figures 1 & 2 show the village institutions created\nunder the project.\n\n\u25cf Participation: All decisions and project activities undertaken followed a participatory approach\nwith at least 70% of the poor being part of the process.\n\n\u25cf Transparency: All project decisions were being taken in the Gram Parishad (Village Executive)\nin an open and transparent manner; Project information was displayed in the village and project\ndocumentation including minutes of accounts books, meetings, and other records will be\nmaintained and made accessible to the village community.\n\nFigure 1. Adapted from the sustainable livelihoods framework.\n\nSource: DFID,1999, p.1. https://www.ennonline.net/attachments/871/dfid-sustainable-livelihoods-guidance-sheet-section1.pdf\n\n2532 S. SHAHRIAR ET AL.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Accountability: At least 80% of all Gram Samitis (Village Councils) received all the install-\nments of the Village Development Fund and had to be rated satisfactory by village communities\nduring the community assessment process.\n\n2.3. Sustainable Livelihoods Approach\n\nThe concept of \u2018Sustainable Livelihoods\u2019 constitute the basis of different \u2018Sustainable Livelihood\nApproaches\u2019 (SLA) and has been adapted by different development agencies such as the British\nDepartment for International Development (DFID). The DFID has developed a \u2018Sustainable\nLivelihood Framework\u2019 (SLF) which is one of the most widely used livelihoods frameworks in\ndevelopment practice. The SLF was integrated in its program for development cooperation in 1997.\nDFID adapts a version of Chambers Conway\u2019s definition of livelihoods: \u201cA livelihood comprises the\ncapabilities, assets and activities required for a means of living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can\ncope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both\nnow and in the future, while not undermining the natural resource base.\u201d (DFID, 1999, p. 1.)\n\nFigure 2. Summary of the village institutions. Source: Community Operational Manual (COM) Booklet\n\nPart 1, p.15. https://www.sdfbd.org/index.php?id=251\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE YOUTH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LOANS IN BANGLADESH 2533\n\nhttps://www.sdfbd.org/index.php?id=251\n\n\n2.4. Vulnerability Contexts\n\nThe vulnerability context frames the external environment in which people exist. Vulnerability emerges\nwhen human beings have to face harmful threat or shock with inadequate capacity to respond effectively.\nThe difference between risk and vulnerability is of crucial relevance for assessing causes of poverty. The\nrisk is defined as the likelihood of occurrence of (external) shocks and stresses plus their potential\nseverity, whereas vulnerability is the degree of exposure to risk (hazard, shock) and uncertainty, and the\ncapacity of households or individuals to prevent, mitigate or cope with risk. As the livelihoods approach\nis concerned first and foremost with people, it seeks to gain an accurate and realistic understanding of\npeople\u2019s strengths (here called \u201cassets\u201d or \u201ccapitals\u201d). It is crucial to analyze how people endeavor to\nconvert these strengths into positive livelihood outcomes. The approach is founded on a belief that\npeople require a range of assets to achieve positive livelihood outcomes. Therefore, the SLF identifies\nfive types of assets or capitals upon which livelihoods are built, namely human capital, social capital,\nnatural capital, physical capital, and financial capital.\n\n2.5. Policies, Institutions, and Processes\n\nThe importance of policies, institutions, and processes cannot be overemphasized, because they\noperate at all levels, from the household to the international arena, and in all spheres, from the\nmost private to the most public. They effectively determine access (to various types of capital, to\nlivelihood strategies and to decision-making bodies and source of influence), terms of exchange\nbetween different types of capitals, and returns to any given livelihood strategy (DFID, 1999).\nPolicies, institutions, and processes have a direct impact upon whether people are able to achieve\na feeling of inclusion and well-being. Policies, institutions, and processes can determine access to\nassets and influence decision-making processes.\n\n2.6. Livelihood Strategies\n\nLivelihood strategies comprise the range and combination of activities and choices that people make/\nundertake in order to achieve their livelihood goals. Livelihood strategies are directly dependent on\nasset status and policies, institutions and processes. Hence, that poor people compete and that the\nlivelihood strategy of one household might have an impact (positive or negative) on the livelihood\nstrategy of another household. Livelihood outcomes are the achievements or outputs of livelihood\nstrategies, such as more income, increased well-being, reduce vulnerability, improved food security\nand more sustainable use of natural resources. When thinking about livelihood outcomes, the aims of\na particular group, as well as the extent to which these are already being achieved, has to be\nunderstood. The sustainable livelihood framework is summarized in Figure 1.\n\n2.7. Main Principles of the Project\n\nThe village institutions are organized on the basis of the following ten principles:\n\n\u25cf We will unite and work together for development\n\u25cf We will maintain transparency and accountability in all kinds of activities\n\u25cf We will first try to solve our problems by ourselves. We will seek outside help only when it is\nneeded\n\n\u25cf We will take all of our decisions on the basis of majority\u2019s opinion\n\u25cf All in our village communities have the equal rights and opportunities\n\u25cf We will be honest in our activities\n\u25cf We will save as much as we can and repay our loans on time\n\u25cf We will complete our activities as per agreed plans\n\n2534 S. SHAHRIAR ET AL.\n\n\n\n\u25cf We will use our resources wisely\n\u25cf We will take shelter and help others take shelter in a safe place during any disaster.\n\n3. Methodology\n\n3.1. Data\n\nTwo fundamental questions guided the data collection strategy. First, what is the nature of the utilization of\nthe youth skills development loan provided under the Women\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood\nImprovement project? Second, what are the institutional frameworks of the projects? The data on which\nthe paper is based were collected from the quarterly process monitoring reports released from 2013 to 2015.\nThe process monitoring reports were prepared by the Center for Natural Resource Studies (CNRS), Dhaka,\nBangladesh, a third-party process-monitoring agency stationed at the different areas of the project. The first\nauthor of this paper worked as a field research officer of the process-monitoring team from 2013 to 2015 and\nvisited a large number of villages under the project. Our datasets are, therefore, unique in several aspects.\nFirst, for the first time, we have collected and utilized the data for research purpose. Second, the data cover\na wide range of issues including rural development, women\u2019s empowerment, livelihoods activities, and\npoverty alleviations. Third, the youth as a major group of stakeholders received little research attention. The\nyouth constitute one-third of the labor force in Bangladesh. In 2013, the youth unemployment rate was\n8.1%, which increased to 10.6% in 2016\u201317. The youth are under-studied in the existing literature. That is\nwhy it is significant to have a closer look at the problems encountered by the youth population as a group.\n\nUp to June 2013, Taka 363,000.00 (Bangladesh\u2019s money is known as taka, 1US dollar is roughly\nequivalent to 80 Taka) was disbursed as youth skill development loan among 107 youths of 12\nvillages under the district of Jamalpur, Bangladesh. It is here to be noted that Jamalpur is one of the\nvulnerable districts in Bangladesh in terms of income and poverty. Up to June 2013, taka 121,830.00\n(33%) was recovered against the disbursement, and current outstanding stood at taka 54,390.00\n(21%) and overdue outstanding is Tk. 2, 04,600.00 (79%). Our original sample size consisted of 107\nyouths from the covered villages, but we dropped 2 youths from the sampling frame due to the lack\nof adequate information. As a result, the present sample size consisted of 105 youths from 12 villages\nfrom the Jamalpur district of Bangladesh.\n\nThe selection of explanatory variables is an old and important problem in econometrics. As\nAmemiya suggested that: \u201cselection of regressors should be based on economic-theoretic considera-\ntions as well as on statistical evidence. Economic theory can often indicate what regressors should be\nincluded in any equation, and sometimes, but less often, a class of functional forms that should be\nconsidered\u201d (Amemiya 1980, 331). The omitted variable bias is a problematic issue in econometrics\n(Wooldridge 2016). We have, therefore, relied on theories, frameworks, and prior empirical studies to\nselect the related variables for the analysis.\n\nFor the analytical purpose, we classified the repayment status into two categories where\u2019s paid on\ntime called repaid and default for that type of borrowers who doesn\u2019t paid on due time. The\nindependent variables which affect the repayment status were as:\n\nIn this study, we use the logit model to identify the factors that affect the borrowers' loan\nrepayment status. This model is relevant in the sense that we are discussing about the default\nloans. The model is designed to identify the key factors affecting the repayment behaviors of the\nyoung borrowers. After all, it will be convenient for us to recommend the way forward to the policy-\nmakers and further research.\n\nThe dependent variable was, accordingly, divided into two categories defined as yt= 1 if there is default\nand yt= 0 if there is repaid on time. There was delinquent respondent also but we merge delinquent and\ndefault as the same category after checking the payment due status because it shows if we get the chance to\ncollect the data after the loan cycle the delinquent borrowers will be ultimately default borrowers.\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE YOUTH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LOANS IN BANGLADESH 2535\n\n\n\n3.2. The Binary Logistic Model\n\nThe dependent variable has two responses, namely \u201c1\u201d treated as the youth is default in payment and\n\u201c0\u201d is indicating the youth is not default:\n\ny \u00bc 1 Default\n0 Not Defalut\n\n\ufffd\n(1)\n\nLogistic regression models work with odds rather than proportions. The odds are just the ratio of the\nproportions for the two possible outcomes. If p\u0302 is the proportion of one outcome, then 1\ufffd p\u0302 is the\n\nproportion for the second outcome and the odds of occurring of the first outcome is p\u0302\n1\ufffdp\u0302 .\n\nThe general logistic regression model is shown in equation (1):\n\nE y\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc e\u03b20\u00fe\u03b21x1\u00fe \u03b22x2\u00fe ............\u00fe \u03b2kxk\n\n1\u00fe e\u03b20\u00fe\u03b21x1\u00fe \u03b22x2\u00fe ............\u00fe \u03b2kxk\n(2)\n\nwhere E y\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc p, the probability of success\nThe xi\u2019s are independent quantitative or qualitative variables. Transformation of the odds P=1\ufffd P\n\nusing the natural logarithm gives the log odds or logit form of odds.\nThen, the model is the log odds as a linear function of the explanatory variable and as follows:\n\ny \u00bc ln\np\n\n1\ufffd p\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\u00bc \u03b20 \u00fe \u03b21x1 \u00fe \u03b22x2 \u00fe . . . . . . . . . . . .\u00fe \u03b2kxk (3)\n\nThe parameters associated with the explanatory variables gives the dependency rates to the response\nvariable.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\n\nThe mean age of the respondents is 24.31 where\u2019s 38 respondents are male and 67 are female. The\naverage loan size is Bangladeshi Tk. 3376.19. The descriptive statistics presented in Table 1 shows\nthat the only 21% of respondents repaid the loan, 47.6% are delinquent and 31.4% are default\nborrowers. Training was a very good factor that affects loan repayment status. In this logistic\nregression model, the dependent variable is converted into a binary response variable. Table 2\ndemonstrates that our estimated model can correctly classify 91.4% of the default prediction with\nthe considered independent variables.\n\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics of the YSDL.\n\nVariables Categories N Percentage Mean SD\n\nGender Male 38 36.2\nFemale 67 63.8\n\nRepayment Status Default 33 31.4\nDelinquency 50 47.6\nRepaid 22 21.0\n\nAge 24.31 3.32\nLoan size 3376.2 1130.9\nDue Payment 1900.3 1735.7\n\nSource: Authors\u2019 estimation\n\n2536 S. SHAHRIAR ET AL.\n\n\n\nIt is revealed from Table 3 that overall five independent variables are considered into the\nestimation parameters for the binary logit model. Three of the independent variables are quantitative\nin nature, namely; the age of the respondents, the amount of loan disbursed to them, amount of\npayment due. On the other hand, two variables are categorical; namely, gender and, education levels.\nData on education level was collected on years of education but due to less amount of variation\namongst the levels of education, it is converted into three groups. The respondents who have no level\nof education is termed as \u201cilliterate\u201d, on the other hand, those who have education levels up to five\nyears, considered as \u201cPrimary\u201d, and above five years of education as the third category. The findings\nof the binary logistic regression model are showing that out of five independent variables, size of the\nloan, due amount of payment and one category of education is significant to determine whether the\nyouth will be a loan defaulter or not. It is found that if the size of the loan is increased then the chance\nof becoming defaulter is also increased significantly (p-value = 0.000) and this is the same for the due\namount of payment. Youth with an increased due amount of payment is at higher chance to become\na defaulter. In case of education, the illiterate category has been considered as the reference category.\nIt is found that the illiterate youth are likely to become defaulters. Moreover, compared to the\nilliterate youth, the primary education completed population has been higher chance to be the\ndefaulter. But the other variables, gender, the age of the respondents are found not significant to\ndetermine the issue of the defaulter.\n\nIt has often been observed that the repayment status can also be categorized into three groups, as,\ndefault, delinquency, and repaid (Nawai and Shariff, 2012). Keeping that categories in the current\nanalysis, a multinomial logit model has been run to compare the predictability of the fitted model as\nwell as the significance of the parameters. The finding of the multinomial logit model reported in\nTable 4 shows that the correct predictability rate is 85.7% which is lower than the binary logit model.\n\nTable 2.

The parameters are estimated in Table 5.\n\n4.1. Case Study of Taluk Habu Village: A Model of Development\n\nThis section consists of experiences and insights gained from the first authors\u2019 fieldwork in\nBangladesh. Taluk Habu is a village under the Cluster # 03 of Rangpur District. Majority of the\npeople in this village is poor and hardcore poor where poverty and discrimination are prevalent. In\nfact, it is a Monga-prone village. Monga (seasonal starvation) is a severe form of poverty that occurs\nand recurs during the lean period of mid-September to November and tends to trigger high chronic\npoverty due to lack of available income sources. Most of the people hardly get three square meals\na day during the Monga.\n\nSDF stared its \u2018NutonJibon\u2019 project in 2011 at this Taluk Habu village.\nPoor and hardcore poor households, identified by the PIP process, were 131 and 104, respectively.\n\nThe project started with forming 16 \u2018Nuton Jibon\u2019 Groups (NJGs) that includes 230 members with\na view to start savings and internal lending activities among the members. Through this program,\ntheir savings currently raises in total to a significant amount of Tk. 287,320. The villagers framed\na participatory plan to change their fortune, and they decided initially to construct some infrastruc-\ntures which would be played an important role for their earnings and livelihood development.\n\nTable 4.

SHAHRIAR ET AL.\n\n\n\nAccording to the plan, 02 roads, 01 office building, 02 culvers, and 25-meter long Palasading was\ndecided to be constructed. A sub-project committee was formed for the implementation of that plan.\nThe villagers built an office on their purchased land (See, the Supplementary Material Figure S3\navailable online).\n\nSDF provided Tk. 1,249,155 for building the office. The NJG members gave Tk. 65,745 as 5%\ncommunity contribution. An office building was constructed with the amount of Tk. 1,203,540. On the\nother hand, SDF further provided Tk. 318,386 and the Nuton Jibon Groupmembers also gave Tk. 15919 for\nthe sub-projects like as; roads, culverts, and Palasading as planned. The villagers completed the sub-project\nworks successfully. The water-logging problem was removed by the culvert (See the Supplementary\nMaterial Figures S1 & Figure S2 available online). The villagers are now in a convenient position regarding\nthe road communication for which students now can easily go to Gangachara for attending schools and\ncolleges. These roads have linked up the villagers with themain road towards the greater district of Rangpur.\n\nIn addition, an amount of more Tk. 5,948,000 was disbursed among the poor and hardcore women as SF.\nVillagers\u2019 now have a wide diversification of work to support their livelihood such as running poultry farm\nand Pisci-culture, making sanitary ring, weaving Benaroshi Shari, preparing vermin compost, etc.. They\nhave also received various capacity building trainings like institutional & leadership development; training\non COM; community financing; Income-generating activities (IGA) training; procurement training; and\ntraining on disaster management, risk reduction, and environment. As a consequence, their socio-economic\nprestige is enhanced. Below are the documentations of a couple of success stories in Bangladesh.\n\n4.2. Success Story-1\n\nMrs. Mabuda Begum is a landless hardcore poor woman who\u2019s PIP # 30. She became a member of\nthe Group, Bokul, in 2011. She is also the cashier of the Savings Committee. Since then, she has been\ndepositing her savings, attending meetings and receiving various trainings. She took Tk. 500 as\ninternal loan and started poultry rearing. In the meantime, the village received the SF. She took Tk.\n10,000 as SF loan on the 12th November 2011 and bought a cow and profited Tk. 16,000 after a year.\nMrs. Mabuda\u2019s husband is a rickshaw puller and they have 03 daughters and 01 son. At a stage,\nMabuda decided to start a poultry farm for which she needed a relatively large amount of money. She\napplied to the Village Credit Organization (VCO) and got a loan of Tk. 50000. With that money, she\nbuilt a tin shed house to run her poultry business. Her husband, Abul Kashem, also help in the farm.\nThey got all three daughters married now. Also, Mabuda has successfully recovered the loan and took\nagain Tk. 50000 as SF. With this 3rd cycle loan, she built another tin shed house on a leased land to\nexpand her poultry business. She has started a poultry shop from where broiler hens are supplied to\nthe buyers. Mabuda said, \u201cI have eradicated poverty with my hard work and proper business plan.\nI am grateful to the SDF\u2019\u2019. She added, \u201cWorking hard for earning is more prestigious than begging\u201d.\nIn this way, Mabuda changed her life (See the Supplementary Material Figure S4 available online).\n\n4.3. Success Story-2\n\nMrs. Jayeda Begum now involving with preparing and marketing of sanitary ring. She took Tk. 30,000 as\n3rd cycle of SF loan from the project. With the support of the loan, she with her husband makes the ring.\nShe has now many buyers of these rings in and out of her villages. Most of the people of \u2018Taluk Habu\u2019\nvillage now use sanitary latrine. This improved sanitary system has contributed to the development of the\npublic health situations at Taluk Habu village.\n\nOur current study contradicts with Uddin\u2019s (2014) conclusion that micro-credit programme fails to\npromote women\u2019s social capital or community mobilization. Recent work from Cambodia reveals the\nsimilar kind of negative impact of micro-credit on household poverty alleviation (Senk 2018). On the\nother hands, Imai and Azam (2012) finds positive impact on income and poverty-reducing effects of\nmicro-credit in Bangladesh. Similarly, Orso and Fabrizi (2016) finds that microcredit interventions in\n\nAN ANALYSIS OF THE YOUTH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LOANS IN BANGLADESH 2539\n\n\n\nBangladesh have positive achievements such as income generation, mobilities, women\u2019s access to the\ninformal channels of education, partner\u2019s attitudinal change, and empowerments. Rahman, Khanam,\nand Nghiem (2017) reported the positive impacts of microfinance on women\u2019s decision-making and\nempowerment. Our current study also finds that the rural youth are positively mobilized through the\nuse of YSDL. Benerjee (2013) provides a detailed review of the concerns, problems, and prospects of\nthe micro-credit in the last few decades with an urge to focus on the detailed behaviors of the\nborrowers and lenders and on the question of whether bigger loans can make a big difference. In fact,\nthe contradictory studies urged scholars to make a call for a \u2018new paradigm\u2019 of microfinance with\na \u2018rethinking of financial factors in real-world economic models\u2019 (Chen and Hou 2017).\n\nPeters (2017) finds that microfinance programs in Bangladesh enhance the likelihoods of female\ngroup action against domestic violence and spousal abandonment. Our study confirms that education\nplays a big role in lending behaviors of the youth. It is, therefore, extremely important to educate the\nrural youths for bringing about a positive change in their behavior patterns. This is in line with the\nfindings of Indian women\u2019s empowerment issues wherein it was reported that 41% were illiterate\n(Chakrabarti and Biswas, 2012).\n\nIn some cases, there are questions in relations to the transparency of the microfinance institutions\n(Tadele, Roberts, and Whiting 2017). A study suggests that the quality of governance is the most\nconsistent driver of economic growth both in the long and short-run (Mamun, Sohag, and Hassan\n2017). So, it is essential to establish the norms of good governance both at the beneficiary and grass-\nroots levels.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nFrom the above findings and analyses, we may conclude that the YSDL plays a major role in the\ncreation of employment opportunities and skill development of the rural poor youth in Bangladesh.\nThere are probabilities that the illiterate youths are likely to be unable to pay their loans within the\ntime-frame. The SDF, as an implementing institution, could pay more attention to the educational\nadvancements of the rural youths. Of course, the diversification of livelihood activities and proper\nutilization of the YSDL are mutually interlinked. The village level community institutions are\nworking on the basis of the ten core principles. Nowadays, the poor people are familiarized with\nthe norms of good governance at the grass roots levels. The implications of our study are highly\npolicy relevant. The understanding of the responsiveness of youth issue is crucial when designing\npoverty reduction strategies, policies, and programs.\n\nThis study contributes to further lines of research. The first one is related to enriching the spectrum\nof pro-poor and pro-youth factors, evaluating, for example, the effects of youth illiteracy and\nunemployment on the poverty elasticity to growth. Then, complementing the macro-based evidence\nhere provided with micro-empirical work would be of great importance to understand why some\nyouths can take advantage of the opportunities brought by economic growth while others cannot.\nThere is also a need for efficiency analysis of the youth training program to find out the actual gaps in\nthe utilization of the YSDL. The time-series and panel econometric methods could be applied in\nfuture. Also, the welfare analysis of the project might contribute to our to a deeper understanding of\nthe micro-credit programs in Bangladesh. The future research endeavors would depend on the\navailability, quality, and coverage of data.\n\nLike any empirical work, however, this study had some limitations. Due to time and resource\nconstraints, we could not increase our sample size and cover more districts under the project. We\nhope the future researchers may overcome the limitations and undertake more empirical studies\non the various dimensions of the project.\n\n2540 S.
