This\narticle argues that contemporary drug normalisation is at the centre of the apparent\nfailure of drug prohibition to understand and respond to the growth in oppositional\nmessages derived from digital communication and the use of drug representations by\nmainstream capitalism to sell everyday commodities for profit. At the same time, UK\nand US newspapers have questioned the validity of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 owing to\npolitical corruption and human rights abuses in Mexico, Afghanistan and Colombia.\nThe article considers that drug normalisation has disrupted drug policy because\nintoxicants have become incorporated into everyday culture, and in particular youth\nsubculture. Within the recent literature, young people\u2019s drug use has been theorised\nwithin a generalised framework of postmodernity. This article argues that drug\nnormalisation theory is not a postmodern concept. It is a theory derived from the\nwork of the Chicago School articulated by Alfred Lindesmith, Howard Becker and\nDavid Matza, who in turn influenced the UK National Deviance Conference and the\nsubsequent CCCS theory of subculture. This created the theoretical opportunity to\ninterpret substance consumption as a condition of normalisation separate from crime.\nBritish Politics (2010) 5, 337\u2013366. doi:10.1057/bp.2010.12\n\nKeywords: youth subculture theory; normalisation; Habermas; legitimation crisis;\ndrug education; drug war politics\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the early twenty-first century, new theories have emerged within the area\nof youth culture and intoxication (Bennett, 2005; Blackman, 2005; Measham\nand Shiner, 2009). In the study of youth subculture, there has been a growth\nin theories, derived from a postmodernist position, offering new terms, for\n\nr 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\nwww.palgrave-journals.com/bp/\n\n\n\nexample \u2018post-subculture\u2019, \u2018scene\u2019 and \u2018tribe\u2019. In the area of youth drug con-\nsumption, a key innovation has been the theory of drug normalisation. Sitting\nalongside these changes in social and cultural theory have been new develop-\nments in government policy towards the control of young people\u2019s lifestyles\nand forms of intoxication (Furlong, 2009). At the same time, representations of\ndisordered alcohol and drug consumption by young people have received\nwidespread coverage within the tabloid press (Kirsh, 2009). The first section\nof this article examines developments in government drug policy, discussing\nhow prohibition has been constructed as a popular preventive to control young\npeople\u2019s use of intoxicants. The second section critically addresses the theory\nof drug normalisation and argues that we have entered a legtimation crisis\nin prohibition policy (Habermas, 1975). In the final part, I shall argue that\nrather than postmodern approaches, the theory of subculture, based on the\nChicago School premise of deviance as natural behaviour and re-articulated\nby the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) (Hall and Jefferson,\n1975), creates the theoretical opportunity to interpret substance consumption\nas a condition of normalisation.\n\nConstructing a Popular Preventive\n\nGovernment drug policy aims to devise ways to prevent young people from\nconsuming illegal substances. Drug use is not a new problem, and neither is the\nrequirement of government to control it. In the United States, Beck (1998),\nlooking at 115 years of drug prevention, suggests that there has been little\nchange, and argues that drug education continues to be constrained by the\nlimited dictates of the \u2018no-use\u2019 injunction. In Britain, recent policy developments\nsuggest a new focus, emphasising the flexibility of harm-reduction approaches.\nFor example, the government website wiredforhealth.gov (2009) states that drug\nprevention aims to: \u2018reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs as measured by the\nDrug Harm Index\u2019. Further, government policy speaks of community, parent\ninvolvement and integrated treatment, suggesting that harm reduction is in the\nascendancy (Stimson, 2007). Within current drug education strategies, I shall\nexamine normative education and role models as two ideas that seek to change\nbehaviour and influence young people to make the \u2018right choice\u2019.\n\nFrom the time of Tackling Drugs Together (Department of Health, 1995),\nthe British government has played a leading role in focusing concern on young\npeople\u2019s drug use through policy statements, briefings and documents (Blackman,\n2004, p. 149). In addition, the public appointment of a US-style Drug Tsar,\nKeith Hellawell, in 1997, brought UK drug policy in line with the American\nstyle of addressing social problems. As a result, public policy attention on drugs\nbecame an everyday feature in the media, presenting a host of high-profile\n\nBlackman\n\n338 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nindividuals from sport, popular entertainment and politics, alongside ordinary\npeople, as victims to demonstrate the dangers of intoxication (Blackman,\n2007). In parliament and the media, the drug debate became fuelled by hatred\nand sadness, where emotions shaped the presentation of drugs as a social\nproblem for \u2018middle England\u2019, on the basis that drugs were \u2018easy to access\u2019, and\nthat \u2018your child\u2019 could be the next victim. Government and media played a\nleading role in expounding the need for a popular preventive. I want to argue\nthat it is not just the case that young people or icons from popular culture\ncontributed to an increased awareness of illicit drugs, but that a major\ncontribution is also directly played by Government and media. By constructing\nthe need for a popular preventive, both government and media went forward\nwith a mandate so that abstinence went on the offensive. The first example of\nthis was the return of cannabis to the Drug Classification B, in January 2009.\nThe second, in October of the same year, was the removal of Professor\nDavid Nutt, Head of the Advisory Council on Drugs Misuse, for criticising\ngovernment policy. Erickson and Hathaway (2010) also identify this change of\nemphasis by suggesting that drug prohibition has reaffirmed its position of\ncontrol.\n\nAt the same time as the British government and media have created the\ncontext for a popular preventive, United Nations Drug reports (2008 and\n2009), as well as government statistics themselves, have demonstrated that drug\nconsumption by young people in the United Kingdom has been in decline. The\nNational Association of Public Health Observatories (2009) claim that there is\nconsiderable variation of drug use by young people between regions in terms of\nthe different types consumed, as well as differing use by men and women.\nA key finding indicated that: \u2018The rate of last year and last month use of any\ndrug nationally has decreased year-on-year between 2002/03 and 2007/08\u2019\n(2009, p. 19). It was further asserted that: \u2018Lifetime prevalence of use of at least\none illicit drug has fallen steadily among young people between 1998 and 2007/\n08\u2019 (ibid, p. 84). At the same time, it was found that there had been an increase\nin cocaine consumption among young people, but a reduction in ecstasy use.\nIt is estimated that in England and Wales there are 2.75 million 16\u201324-year olds\nwho have used at least one drug in their lifetime, and three-quarters of a\nmillion who have used a drug in the previous month (Hoare and Flatley, 2008).\nDrugscope (2009) maintain that prevalence data gathered by the NHS, Ofsted,\nthe Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), and the European\nMonitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addictions (EMCDDA, 2007) all\nsuggest that the number of young people using drugs is falling. The political\nparadox is that UK government statistics, along with the drug reports from\nthe United Nations (UN) and Europe, demonstrate that the United Kingdom\ndoes have a drug use problem, but that drug use itself is in decline. Recently,\nboth government and media combined to construct a popular preventive\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n339r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nfocused on the legal drug mephedrone, or \u2018meow meow\u2019. Measham et al (2010,\np. 19) argue that the limited success of prohibition itself is a causal factor in the\nuse of mephedrone, as drug users turn to unfamiliar and under-researched che-\nmicals that are easily purchased online. Currently, there exist a range of websites\noffering to purchase Herbal Highs, such as headshop.co.uk, Am-Hi-Co.com and\nherbalaromas.co.uk. Thus, conflicting data about the extent of drug use demon-\nstrate that constructing a popular preventive is socially complex and does not\ndepend solely on facts or science. It also raises the question of whether prohi-\nbition holds wider ambitions to eradicate the human desire for intoxication.\n\nNew Developments: Blueprint\n\nThe current UK drug strategy 2008\u20132018 talks about protecting communities,\ndealing with drug-related crime and anti-social behaviour, preventing harm to\nyoung people, delivering new approaches to drug prevention and social\nre-integration alongside public information campaigns, communications and\ncommunity engagement. Three recent policy initiatives have focused, first, on\nthe link between drugs and alcohol, for example, the Youth Alcohol Action Plan\n(Department for Children, Schools and Families, 2008); second, there has been\nthe development of the Blueprint drug education programme in schools (Home\nOffice, 2007); and, third, the government has banned \u2018legal highs\u2019 (BBC News,\n25 August 2009). In 2009, the lead item \u2018What\u2019s New\u2019 on the Home Office\nwebsite: Tackling Drugs, Changing Lives announced the success of the Blueprint\ndrug education programme. On the government wiredforhealth website,\nBlueprint claims that the development of the new drug education programme\nis \u2018evidenced-based from \u201cWorldwide research\u201d \u2019. A central strategy of the pro-\ngramme is the theoretical model of \u2018normative education\u2019. \u2018Drugs: Guidance\nfor Schools\u2019 (Department for Education and Skills, 2004, p. 7) states: \u2018Research\nshows that certain models of drug education can achieve modest reductions in\nthe consumption of cannabis, alcohol and tobacco\u2019. Thus:\n\nNormative education is important because young people often over-\nestimate how many of their own age group drink, smoke or use illegal\ndrugs y Recent research demonstrates that normative education is a\nhighly important positive influence on knowledge and behaviour change.\nIt also provides opportunities within the curriculum to address attitude\ndevelopment and discuss what influences young people\u2019s decision-\nmaking. (ibid, p. 20)\n\nBlueprint argues that during lessons, the aim is to ensure that \u2018endorsement of\ndrug use is not as widespread as they (young people) may think it is\u2019. For BBC\n\nBlackman\n\n340 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nNews, Ollie Stone-Lee (10 May 2005) reported the Drugs Minister, Paul\nGoggins, saying that there must be an \u2018unremitting\u2019 message to young people\nthat \u2018drugs are bad for you\u2019. Normative education is based on the idea that\nit challenges young people\u2019s views and opinions about drug use in society.\nNiall Coggans (2006, p. 420) argues that the key assertion in the approach is\nthat young people have an \u2018incorrect perception of reality\u2019, or that, as govern-\nment policy states, young people have \u2018misconceptions\u2019. Thus, government and\ndrug educators have set themselves the task of correcting young people\u2019s\nmisrepresentations. Normative education sets out to change behaviour, seeks\nto understand young people in a wider context and addresses the social and\ncultural factors that influence them. The key point in the model of normative\ndrug education is that young people overestimate drug use and the cultural\nacceptability of drugs (Baker, 2006; Foxcroft, 2006).\n\nWhile normative education suggests that it is taking a holistic approach,\nhoused within it remains a behaviourist perspective, with a concentration on\nthe individual, their personality and social group networks. The argument that\nyoung people are at risk from their friends and youth culture leads back to the\nnotion of peer pressure (Coggans and McKeller, 1994; Blackman, 2004).\nNormative education is dependent on the notion of peer pressure because it\nargues that young people are collectively influenced by factors outside them.\nThis means that it defines young people as being in deficit and lacking\nautonomy to make the correct decisions to resist drug use (O\u2019Connor et al,\n1998). However, the assertion that young people possess a misunderstanding,\nor an over-exaggeration, sets a dangerous precedent in understanding drugs in\nsociety (McInnes and Barrett, 2007). A key absence in the literature relating to\nBlueprint is the lack of any theoretical and empirical understanding of young\npeople\u2019s youth culture. For Blueprint, the link to popular culture is undertaken\nthrough Media Road Shows and via media relations to be undertaken by the\nPR company Porter Novelli, owned by the American corporation, Omnicom.\nThe evidence base upon which young people are to be corrected lacks not only\nhistorical, but also contemporary knowledge and research concerning the\nsocial and cultural complexities of young people\u2019s popular youth culture.\nAlthough the research put forward by Blueprint is feasible and is built on an\nevidence base, its weakness is the absence of an understanding of young\npeople\u2019s lifestyle and identity (Hunt et al, 2010).\n\nRole Models, Celebrities and the Wrong Message\n\nGovernment policy tends to combine role models and peer educators and this\nis confirmed in drugs education policy at schools. The Advisory Group on\nDrug and Alcohol Education (2008, p. 46) states that: \u2018peer educators can\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n341r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nbecome positive role models and a valuable resource for younger pupils\u2019. The\nadoption of role models as an idea is theoretically understood as emulation.\nStorey (1999, p. 8) notes that to emulate is to copy, and as a result the theory\ntends to define young people as passive rather than active consumers of\nmessages. Emulation theory fails to offer an interactive understanding of how\nyoung people communicate, especially given the evidence from qualitative\nstudies, which show that neither deviance nor hedonism is the sole motivation\nfor drug consumption (Wilson, 2006; Anderson, 2009). The notion of role\nmodels has been central to government policy,1 and forms part of the Home\nOffice social inclusion strategy, the Positive Futures Programme, which states\nthat \u2018as a catalyst to encourage project participation we steer young people\ntowards education, training and employment\u2019. The Home Office drug strategy,\nDrugs: Protecting Families and Communities (2008, pp. 26, 35), also argues that\nthe government will work with national and local role models, and especially\nsports people who are identified as positive role models for young people.\n\nMowlam and Creegan (2008, p. 14) found that there was a \u2018lack of positive\nrole models for children and young people to look up to and to learn from\u2019. The\nonline forum, Children and Young People Now, also encountered the same\nproblem. At the start of 2009, it set up a discussion board to put forward role\nmodels to promote to young people. One example put forward by young people\nthemselves was Eminem. American social theorist Robert Merton (1949, pp.\n302\u2013303) is credited with introducing the term \u2018role model\u2019 into sociology. He\nsuggested that a reference individual is a role model, where \u2018the person identifies\u2019\nwith and \u2018will seek to approximate the behaviour and values of a peer, a parent\nor public figure\u2019. Eminem (1999) wrote his song \u2018Role Model\u2019 for The Slim\nShady LP, a rap that seeks to challenge the passive notion of social emulation by\nturning agency on its head. Eminem raps about taking drugs, truanting, alcohol,\nsex with women who have HIV, killing people and self-harm, and asks \u2018do you\nwant to grow-up like me\u2019? Ironically, Eminem\u2019s approach falls within the shock-\ntactics style of drug intervention, the message of which is \u2018do these things and\nyou will be dead\u2019. In essence, he is presenting himself as an anti-role model for\nyoung people. Although Eminem\u2019s message is in opposition to the public\npresentation of positive role models, which government and the media uphold,\nthe aim remains the same, to be a positive influence on youth.\n\nIn Australia, Roche et al (2009) demonstrate that government policy is\npredicated on the belief in \u2018sending the right message\u2019, which establishes the\ngrounds for more punitive drug policy, but they urge caution. In contrast, in\nthe United Kingdom, the moral outcry against bad role models for young\npeople has occurred at different levels in society. Firstly, the UN has\ncondemned Britain\u2019s \u2018celebrity culture of intoxication\u2019, singling out \u2018offenders\u2019\nsuch as Pete Doherty and Amy Winehouse. Under-Secretary General of the\nUN, Antonio Maria Costa (9 March 2008), argued that British celebrities\n\nBlackman\n\n342 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nfrom the world of popular culture promote drug abuse through their influential\nposition. The UN claimed that celebrities \u2018can profoundly influence attitudes,\nvalues and behaviour, particularly among young people\u2019 (Emafo, 2008). The\nBBC also reported a warning from Philip Emafo, President of the International\nNarcotics Control Board, that when celebrities took illegal drugs: \u2018It glamo-\nrized narcotic abuse\u2019 (BBC News, 3 May 2008). Second, in 2008 Justin\nDavenport and Anne McElvoy, in the Evening Standard (Davenport and\nMcElvoy, 2008), reported that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian\nBlair, had called \u2018for celebrities who are filmed apparently taking drugs to be\nput on trial\u2019. Scotland Yard said the commissioner was \u2018reflecting a view of\nmany ordinary people\u2019. Third, Members of Parliament have also been\ninvolved. The Labour MP, Dr Denis MacShane, for example, said that \u2018the\npolice and prosecutors should arrest, detain, charge and seek prison sentences\nfor famous rock-stars, sportsmen, and the super-rich who use cocaine but\nalways escape prosecution\u2019. Thus:\n\nEvery parent is sickened at the way the celebrities who fill up the pages of\nHeat and Hello are allowed to get away with behaviour which is a terrible\nexample to younger people. If schoolchildren and students see the names\nthey admire in a state of intoxication from drugs and drink then they will\nfollow suit. I want to see some of these people in prison. (M. Hookham,\n\u2018Celebrity cocaine snorters slammed\u2019, Daily Star, 14 June 2008)\n\nThe notion of role model is actively used in tabloid journalism and on celebrity\nwebsites. It is part of popular culture, and an increased awareness of its diverse\napplications would benefit those who seek to influence young people.\n\nDrug Normalisation\n\nThe political economy of the drug trade\n\nHistorically, drug production and consumption have been promoted by the\nstate and intertwined with the economy, where legitimate businesses have given\npriority to the extraction of surplus value from intoxicants (Davenport-Hines,\n2001). From the onset of European colonial empires, the subject of drugs has\nbeen concerned with power, capital and politics, not only to extract wealth but\nalso to rule other civilisations. Early entrepreneurs from the British East India\nCompany were eager to harness the financial rewards of opium to consolidate\nthe British Empire in Asia. The drug became institutionalised through private\nand state interventions, making it the world\u2019s most valuable single commodity\nby 1839 (Chouvy, 2009). In South America, the Spanish Empire was quick to\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n343r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nrealise the financial benefits of drugs to the Church, the colonial economy and\nthe state. Inglis (1975, p. 52) argues that the Spanish rulers in Peru made quick\nfortunes on the slopes of the Andes with their coca plantations, and these\nentrepreneurs: \u2018Would use their influence to persuade the colonial authorities\nthat it was essential to the colony\u2019s economy; and \u2013 particularly if they could\nextract revenue out of the drug \u2013 the colonial authorities would usually allow\nthemselves to be persuaded\u2019. McCoy (1991, p. 92) states that during their three\ncenturies on Java:\n\nthe Dutch created the largest and most lucrative of the colonial opium\nmonopolies y From 1640 to 1799, the Dutch East India Company\nimported an average of 56 tons of opium annually, large quantities for\nthe day and the amount rose steadily throughout the nineteenth century\nto 208 tons by 1904 y Although the Dutch began reducing their sales in\nthe early twentieth century, in 1929 it was still operating 1065 opium dens\nthat retailed 59 tons of opium to 101 000 registered smokers.\n\nThe intervention of prohibition under the League of Nations, and then the UN,\noutlawed drug production as part of the legal economy, and hence the\nillicit drug industry went underground and became criminalised. Since the\nSecond World War, \u2018drug war\u2019 politics have been defined by American covert\noperations, which have underscored their foreign policy aspirations, where the\nlinks between the CIA and international criminal organisations, and also the\nsupport for corrupt regimes, have seen large-scale violations of human rights\n(Friesendorf, 2007; Campbell H, 2009). As a result, drugs have been utilised\nnot only as a strategy for political intervention through military support, but\nalso as a means to enable the growth of rogue business enterprises that exploit\nillicit substances such as a mechanism for capital accumulation (Bertram et al,\n1996; Bickerstaff, 2009). Today, in Mexico, for example, there is a war\noccurring between the different drug militia, the Mexican Army and the US\nDrug Enforcement Agency. Hawley (2009) reports from Villa Ahumada for\nUSA Today, stating that Griselda Munoz: \u2018found her son at a morgue with his\nskull caved in and four bullet holes in his chest. He was among the 21 people\nkilled in this town near the US border after drug gangs abducted several men,\nthen fought a massive running gun battle with the Mexican army\u2019. The scale of\nthe human disaster is high, with the BBC News reporting (24 February 2009)\nthat beheadings, attacks on the police and shootings in clubs and restaurants\nare a daily occurrence, resulting in approximately 6000 people being killed in\nviolence related to organised drug crime last year.\n\nWhile the Mexican drug lords supply America\u2019s demand for drugs, in\nEurope the Netherlands remains a top destination for drug tourism (Korf,\n2002). Holland\u2019s decriminalisation of small amounts of cannabis has fed into\n\nBlackman\n\n344 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nthe cultural development of the Coffeeshop trade. Coffeeshops were first\nopened in the mid-1970s, but the change in the law goes back to the early\n1960s. The Dutch government have been accused of encouraging drug tourism,\nand indeed one of the key factors in cannabis normalisation are the different\n\u2018Cannabis Cups\u2019,2 which highlight the popular agrarian success of the plant\n(Uitermark, 2004). Contemporary drug tourism is now linked to commercial\nopportunities related to the increased liberalisation of drug laws. As Reuter\nand Stevens (2007, p. 62) state:\n\na few European countries, notably the Netherlands and Portugal, have\neffectively decriminalized the possession of small amounts of cannabis.\nThis has been done by replacing criminal with civil penalties, or, in the\nNetherlands, by introducing a formal written policy for the expedient\ntolerance of distribution and possession of limited amounts of the drug.\n\nThese liberal changes at policy level are also symptomatic of the growth of\ncorporate medical interest in the potential of cannabis. Developments in\ncannabis research are undertaken by various corporate companies, and GW\nPharmaceuticals and Bayer (licensed by the British government to conduct\nresearch in this area) have announced the submission of a new drug, Sativexs,\na cannabis-based medicinal extract product, for approval for use in Canada\nand Spain. In the United States, 14 states use cannabis as a medical drug, and\nthe Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California\nconducts clinical trials.3 Clearly, there is no shortage of government resources\nin terms of funding cannabis research.\n\nNormalisation theory: Its theoretical origins, position and critics\n\nIn Chilling Out (Blackman, 2004, p. 127), I pointed out that a weakness of drug\nnormalisation theory was the lack of \u2018historical context to understand drugs in\nsociety\u2019. This failing has now received some correction from Blackman (2007)\nand Measham and Shiner (2009). It was Alfred R. Lindesmith (1938, p. 597)\nwho first applied the sociological term \u2018normality\u2019 in relation to understanding\ndrug consumption. Lindesmith was a PhD student at the University of Chicago\nwho interacted with key members of the Chicago School (such as Louis Wirth\nand Ernest Burgess), providing him with a grounding in interactionist theory,\nwhich also emphasised the critical role of fieldwork and the in-depth treatment\nof qualitative data (Galliher et al, 1998). Lindesmith\u2019s close connection with\nthe Chicago School enabled him to make the link between the study of the drug\nuser in their natural surroundings and getting research subjects to tell their\nstories. It is clear that the Chicago School\u2019s emphasis on field studies and\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n345r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nbiographical narrative, alongside the approach of the \u2018Youths\u2019 Own Story\u2019,\nwere fertile grounds for Lindesmith to build his understanding of normality\napplied to drug use. At the Chicago School, under Robert Park, the socio-\nlogical approach and the application of qualitative research methods focused\non understanding the social and cultural context of actions and meaning,\nwithout reducing young people\u2019s actions to symptoms of psychological\ninadequacy. Explanation was not only sought in the lives and culture of\npeople in their environment, but also to understand behaviour within the\ncontext of social normality \u2013 that is, in relation to a person\u2019s position in the\nsocial structure and their relationship within the community. Lindesmith\u2019s\napproach towards the study of the drug consumer became central to the next\ngeneration at the Chicago School in the 1950s and 1960s (Becker, 2010, private\ncommunication). Among these, Howard Becker\u2019s early studies on marihuana\nuse became part of the new theoretical perspective of labelling theory later\nadvanced in his study Outsiders (Becker, 1963). Becker\u2019s focus on participant\nobservation within an ethnographic framework saw drug consumption as a\nvictimless crime where people in social groups pursued intoxicated pleasure.\nThis represents an early example of drug normalisation.\n\nIn Britain, during the 1960s, the key figures at the National Deviance\nConference moved towards the development of a more indigenous and\nsophisticated form of British labelling theory to interpret deviant practices\n(Blackman, 2004, p. 111). Here, the work of Howard Becker and David Matza\nhad a major impact on Jock Young\u2019s (1971) study The Drugtakers. Measham\nand Shiner (2009, p. 504) specify that Young\u2019s major contribution was to argue\nthat the subterranean values of drug consumption were part of the dominant\nethos: \u2018Rather than forming isolated moral regions, subterranean values and\nformal values were considered to be mutually dependent upon one another\u2019.\nHowever, it was the ideas of Matza (1964, 1969) that were fundamental to\nboth Young, and then Parker (1974), especially given that both focused on the\nidea of bringing the so-called deviant drug user into conventional under-\nstanding through collapsing the boundary between what is upheld as normal\nand deviant. Although both Young and Parker focus on different social class\nfractions, with the former being preoccupied with the affluent middle classes,\nand with the latter focusing on deprived working-class youth, both identify\nthat these different sets of young people are engaged in subterranean leisure\npractices, but both suffer from deviance amplification. In Parker\u2019s (1974, p. 14)\nstudy View From the Boys, he positions his qualitative study on downtown\nyouth based on Matza\u2019s (1969) elaboration of the Chicago School approach of\nnaturalism \u2018to remain true to the phenomenon he is studying\u2019. In terms of the\npolitics of fieldwork and the theoretical descriptions of a culture under social\nand economic constraint, Parker\u2019s early study follows in the tradition of the\nChicago School ethnographies of young deviants.\n\nBlackman\n\n346 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nThe \u2018drug normalisation thesis\u2019 emerged during the 1990s and has\nsubsequently evolved into a dual theory, which is applied within macro and\nmicro analyses of drug consumption issues. One of its problems is that theorists\nhave employed this flexibility to move between levels of analysis. The theory\noriginated from the work of Howard Parker and his research team at the\nUniversity of Manchester, through a series of publications on the North West\nLongitudinal Study. In Illegal Leisure, Parker et al (1998, p. 152) state that the\ntheory of drug normalisation\n\nrefers only to the use of certain drugs, primarily cannabis but also\nnitrites, amphetamines and equivocally LSD and ecstasy. Heroin and\ncocaine are not included in the thesis. Similarly chaotic combination drug\nuse and dependent \u2018daily\u2019 drug use form no part of our conceptualization.\n\nThey further argue (ibid, pp. 153\u2013157) that there are six key factors that result\nin drug normalisation, namely drug availability, drug trying, drug use, being\ndrug wise, future intentions and the cultural accommodation of the illicit.\nParker (2005, p. 213) has suggested that another part of the drug normalisation\nthesis is increased recognition in British drug policy of the possibility of non-\nproblematic drug use. This fits alongside the idea that normalisation describes\npatterns of \u2018sensible drug consumption which are a \u201cbarometer of changes\nin social behaviour and cultural perspectives\u201d \u2019 (Parker et al, 2002, p. 943). The\nevidence put forward for drug normalisation by Parker et al (1998) is broadly\ntwofold: statistical data, specifying large numbers of young people who claim\nto have used drugs, in terms of frequency and regularity, and changes in\nculture, which they identify as being more \u2018drug centred\u2019.\n\nMeasham and Shiner (2009, p. 502) point out that, \u2018although widely\naccepted, the normalisation thesis has been contested\u2019, creating \u2018sides\u2019 which\nhave been \u2018divisive\u2019. Two leading critics have been Shiner and Newburn (1997\nand 1999), who focus on normalisation as a form of exaggeration and inaccu-\nracy, and also Shildrick (2002, pp. 45\u201346), who contends that the concept of\nnormalisation \u2018imposes its own meta-narrative on young people\u2019s experiences\u2019\nand is \u2018a potentially destructive concept\u2019. In this there is some commonality\nwith Shiner and Newburn, in that Shildrick considers that the normalisation\nthesis overstates the extent of drug consumption and fails to consider issues of\nsocial class inequalities. Although at times Shildrick is critical of normalisation,\nshe ultimately prefers to revise rather than reject the concept by proposing\n\u2018differentiated normalisation\u2019 to account for different types of drugs and drug\nuse (ibid, p. 36).\n\nSupport for the Parker et al (1998) argument relating to the normalisation of\nrecreational drugs comes from a series of qualitative empirical studies.\nResearch undertaken by Malbon (1999), Hammersley et al (2002), Duff\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n347r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\n(2003, 2004, 2005), Jackson (2004), Harling (2007) and Measham and Moore\n(2009) focuses on choices and decisions applied by young people to their drug\nuse, especially in the context of enjoyment. This does not mean that these\nstudies fail to focus on risk, as some of the research subjects in these studies do\nhighlight some of their negative encounters with intoxicants. Normalisation is\nnot just a matter of the disparity between drug users\u2019 experiences and the\nmessage of prohibition, nor is it that these studies support the rationality of\ndrug users. It is clear that diverse forms of drug consumption are part of an\nattempt by young people within their cultural context to give order to their\nlives. For young people, drug use is understood as offering security, identity\nand expression. The outcome for young people is that participation in the\nnormalisation of intoxication has resulted in youth being the object of regula-\ntion and control. As a result, surveillance cultures have increased the regulation\nof everyday life, thereby revealing the use of intoxicants, which establishes\nthe necessity for further intervention and control (France, 2008).\n\nLegitimation Crisis in Drug Prohibition\n\nIn this section, I want to look at the question of whether drug prohibition has\nentered a period of a legitimation crisis as outlined by Jurgen Habermas (1975),\nwhere institutions are out of step with social and cultural values and govern-\nment faces a loss of public confidence. In the United Kingdom, the UN global\ndrug policy is being upheld, but at the same time the \u2018drug war\u2019 policy that\nunderlies prohibition has been questioned (Bewley-Taylor, 2003). New\nZealand, the Netherlands and Portugal, for example, have all undertaken\ndegrees of drug reform and oppose the drug war approach to drug prevention.4\n\nThe UN asserts that its role is to tell the truth about drugs on a scientific basis\nin order to achieve security. However, Jacques Derrida (1993, p. 2) disputes\nthese claims of legitimacy and argues that prohibition is based on \u2018moral and\npolitical evaluations\u2019. One of the key principles of the \u2018drug war\u2019 approach is\nthat information concerning drugs should be against drug use, in contrast to\ninformation about drug use (Dorn and Murji, 1992).\n\nCrucially, Habermas (1975, p. 97) claims that: \u2018What is controversial is\nthe relation of legitimation to truth\u2019. Below are a series of media headlines from\nthe United States and the United Kingdom, which question the drug war\napproach to prohibition policy.5 Consider, for example: The Wall Street\nJournal, \u2018The War on Drugs is a Failure\u2019 (Cardoso, Gaviria and Zedillo, 2009);\nCNN, \u2018War on Drugs is Insane\u2019 (Cafferty, 2009); the New York Times, \u2018Drugs\nWon The War\u2019 (Kristof, 2009); and Benson and Rasmussen (2000), The\nAmerican Drug War: Anatomy of a Futile and Costly Police Action (which\ndetails the negative impact of the drug war on public health and the\n\nBlackman\n\n348 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\ncriminalisation of young people). In the United Kingdom, Simon Jenkins\nstates that: \u2018The war on drugs is immoral idiocy\u2019, (Jenkins, 2009); BBC News\nnotes, \u2018Phoney UK drug war criticised\u2019 (18 May 2009); Bruce Robbins reports\nfor The Courier: Tayside and Fife, that: \u2018Police force losing war on drugs\u2019\n(Robbins, 2008); and Duncan Campbell for The Guardian (Campbell D, 2009)\nrecords a UN drugs report detailing that there is \u2018no evidence that the global\ndrug problem was reduced\u2019. Looking at these newspaper stories, the clear\nmessage being put forward is that the drug war has failed. The death of\ninnocent people and the corruption of government officials would indicate that\nthe UNs\u2019 drug prohibition policy is both wrong and damaging to society\n(Klein, 2008). The problem for the UN and for governments is that under\nincreased questioning of their legitimacy, they are forced to justify their own\nexistence and power in the face of the collapse of their authority to argue\nthat prohibition is a truth. One response to a decline in legitimacy is to respond\nin a disciplinary or punitive way, As Habermas (1975, p. 93) states: \u2018Crisis\ntendencies that appear y can be traced back to structures that have resulted\nfrom suppression\u2019.\n\nFor Habermas, one of the key conditions of the legitimation crisis is the\nfailure of democratic states to rectify the contradictions engendered by late\ncapitalism. Since the 1990s, we have seen how capitalism has become more\nexplicitly linked to representations of drugs within society, resulting in a\ncontradiction in that drugs are illegal, but these images are exploited by\ncorporate companies to sell commodities for profit. In the last 15 years, the\nmost significant change in the representation of illicit drugs has been the advent\nof the internet, which has brought forth a vast array of images related to drugs.\nPreviously, the representations of illicit drugs were linked to certain popular\nmusic artists, festivals, youth cultures, films, novels, magazines and selected\nterrestrial television programmes. Now, not only does the internet carry all the\nprevious representations mentioned, but it has also enabled new organisations\nand individuals to put forward their stance on the drugs debate. This change\nhas brought an expansion of myriad sources of information about drugs, which\nare both pro- and anti-drugs. For example, consider the huge range of prohi-\nbition videos on YouTube, which highlight the dangers of drug consumption.\nThen, in contrast, it is possible to watch spoof anti-drug videos, or view images\nof ordinary young people apparently in states of intoxication. The internet has\nseen the birth of DIY drug representations of individual experience. In a sense,\nwe are now seeing the Chicago School deviants \u2018own story\u2019 through the lens of\ndigital technologies. What is significant about drug information on the internet\nis not just the question of accuracy or misinformation, but that we may have\nreached what Habermas (1975) calls a crisis in sources of legitimate informa-\ntion. The authority of the prohibition message derives from the governing\nstructures, but the growth of alternative sources of drug information means\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n349r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nthat the state is unable to demonstrate the function for which it was instituted,\nthat is, to achieve drug prevention.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, during 2009\u20132010, the government faced severe\nquestioning in the media concerning the sacking of their chief drug advisor,\nProfessor Nutt, head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs\n(ACMD).6 Habermas (1975, p. 47) argues that: \u2018A legitimation deficit means\nthat it is not possible by administrative means to maintain or establish effective\nnormative structures to the extent required\u2019. In January 2009, the UK govern-\nment also reclassified cannabis from Class C to Class B, five years after\ndowngrading it. However, in April 2008, the ACMD advised against\nreclassification, but the government did not heed the advice of its experts.\nHabermas (1975, p. 69) states that: \u2018If governmental crisis management fails,\nit lags behind programmatic demands that it has placed on itself. The penalty for\nthis failure is withdrawal of legitimation\u2019. It is clear that the case of Professor Nutt\nconfirms the analysis of Habermas (1975, p. 70), who also states that: \u2018The\npersonalisation of substantive issues\u2019 here acts as \u2018confirming and exploiting\nexisting structures of prejudice y through appeals to feeling\u2019 in trying to regain\nlegitimate government. The movement of cannabis back and forth along the drug\nclassification matrix, and the opposition to senior government experts by\ngovernment ministers, is a clear example of a legitimation crisis caught in action.\n\nIf prohibition messages from the UN or the UK Parliament fail to tackle\nthe promotion of drug representations, then government is seen as lacking the\nauthority to properly govern. This is made more complicated by broader\ncultural changes. Blackman (2007, p. 54) argues that through the commodi-\nfication of popular culture drug use has become embedded within society as a\nfeature of mainstream consumption. Corporate companies including Faberge,\nYves Saint Laurent, Virgin, Body Shop, Sony and Fila have used images of\ndrugs to market their respective products, irrespective of whether there is any\nlink between their product and intoxication (Blackman, 2004, pp. 75\u201381). Here,\ndrugs go beyond the idea of \u2018cultural accommodation\u2019, because they feature\nas a mediating device between producers and consumers. Entrepreneurs have\nmanipulated the risky, exciting and cool side of their products to mirror the\ndesires of young people within their youth cultural lifestyle. From Virgin\nmobile phones to the Body Shop, hemp products present cannabis as an\nordinary commodity alongside common items of shampoo or cre\u0300me, yet the\nuse of the cannabis leaf as a marketing symbol conveys the transgressive power\nand thrill of the illicit. For example, in 2008\u20132009 the soft drink Cocaine\nattracted negative attention from tabloid newspapers and the BBC. The poster\ncampaign for Cocaine included a line of white powder on a black background,\nplus erotic and satanic representations of young women. Business is not taking\na leading role in marketing drug consumption, but through accessing \u2018insider\nknowledge\u2019 the entrepreneur is able draw upon drugs as a source or field of\n\nBlackman\n\n350 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nknowledge of infinite marketability. Clearly, we can see a contradiction here\nbetween drug prohibition and private enterprise\u2019s use of drug imagery.\nHabermas (1975, p. 27) talks of \u2018contradiction\u2019 where \u2018individuals and groups\nrepeatedly confront one another with claims and intentions that are, in the long\nrun incompatible\u2019.\n\nThe politics of drug normalisation directly relate to the way in which drugs have\nbecome incorporated into everyday culture such that its resonance may be\nunknown (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988, p. 286). The UN and governments may\ndeclare that drugs are illegal and harmful, but capitalism has identified drug\nimagery as a major source of income generation, as a site of mediation through\nwhich their products can receive a new lease of life. The marketing of drug-\nreferenced material has created a contradiction at the centre of macro drug policy.\nThe problem for the UN is that the message that drugs are dangerous may be\nunderstood as hollow while corporate companies manipulate drug meanings to sell\ntheir commodities (Hallam and Bewley-Taylor, 2010). This is how normalisation\nhas disrupted drug policy. Drugs have been integrated into the capitalist consumer\nmarket while being illegal. Drugs have to be understood in their full cultural, social\nand economic context, not solely as a matter of health, social policy or crime.\n\nYouth Subculture: Setting Out the Field of Oppositions\n\nIn the last 10 years, there has been an expansion in subcultural studies, not only\nin terms of empirical studies, but also in theoretical analysis. The trajectory of\nthe contemporary subcultural debate can be set out in a range of positions:\n\n\u2018Post-\u2019, \u2018after-\u2019 and \u2018beyond-\u2019 subculture: Redhead (1997), Muggleton (2000),\nMuggleton and Weinzierl (2003), Bennett and Kahn-Harris (2004), Moore\n(2004), Greener and Hollands (2006), Huq (2006).\nNeo tribe: Hetherington (1992), Bennett (1999, 2005), Rief (2009), Riley et al\n(2010).\nDefence of subculture: Hodkinson (2002), Blackman (2005), Haenfler (2006),\nShildrick and MacDonald (2006), Wilson (2006), McAuley (2007), Sandberg\nand Pedersen (2009), Gunter (2010).\nScene: Hesmondhalgh (2005), Huq (2006), Anderson (2009).\n\nSubculture is a contested concept that fuels argument and forces theorists\nto take positions in relation to the theory of subculture set out by the CCCS\n(Hall and Jefferson, 1975). The basic stance is either to retain or reject the CCCS\nconcept of subculture based on an acceptance or a refusal of postmodernism.\nRunning alongside this debate, we have the issue of how drugs are under-\nstood within young people\u2019s groups. Thus, we have two oppositional\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n351r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\ntheories: traditional subcultural, which defines drug use as deviant, and\npostmodern approaches, which understand drug use as non-deviant.\n\nDrug normalisation theory developed by Parker et al (1998, p. 26) asserts\nthat there is a \u2018demise of youth cultures and subcultures\u2019, which \u2018underpins the\npost modernist\u2019s explanation of social change. This too fits with the issue of\ndrug availability and the increasingly wide range of illicit drugs used by young\npeople\u2019. The apparent increased use of drugs is explained by the normalisation\ntheory in terms of non-deviant drug-taking by young people, and thus further\nreduces the relevance of subculture theory because it is tied to deviance.\nDrug normalisation aims to go beyond the apparent narrow understanding\nof deviance linked to subculture by showing that drug use has become part of\nmainstream normalised youth culture. It would appear that for Parker et al\n(1998), poly-drug use is an expression of drug normalisation, which can only be\nexplained through postmodern understandings of young people\u2019s actions\nwhere risk has become routine. Young people\u2019s drug use is theorised within\na generalised framework of postmodernity, but Parker et al (1998, p. 22)\ndo acknowledge uncertainty about the postmodern argument by stating that\n\u2018making these connections is another matter\u2019. In other words, they tiptoe\naround the application of postmodern theory to drugs, wanting to embrace\nBeck\u2019s (1992) ideas of risk but wishing to retain structural inequality, as they\nstill freely use the term subculture (Parker et al, 1998, pp. 152, 256, 158).\nShildrick and MacDonald (2006, p. 127) argue that postmodern approaches\nare more focused on music cultures, dance and stylistic groups. Anderson\n(2009, p. 14) supports this argument, but there is contrary evidence to suggest\nthat a range of studies on goth, punk and UK hip hop (that is, grime and rave\ncultures) uphold the concept of subculture (Hodkinson, 2002; Haenfler, 2006;\nDedman, 2010). Wilson\u2019s (2006, p. 171) ethnography on rave culture is suppor-\ntive of the term subculture, and claims that dance culture is a \u2018prototypical\ntwenty-first century subculture\u2019.\n\nThe New Subcultural Debate Emerges\n\nTwo major contributions to this debate have come from Jenks (2005)\nSubculture: the Fragmentation of the Social, and Gelder (2007) Subcultures:\nCultural Histories and Social Practices. Both studies offer insights and new\nground to interpret the concept of subculture and see drugs as a feature of\ndeviance. Jenks locates subculture centrally within the discipline of sociology,\ntracing its origins and understanding within different paradigms. Gelder is\nmore focused on the historical and literary contexts of subcultural actions from\nthe sixteenth century to the present day. Both assert that the origins of the term\nsubculture derive from the work of the Chicago School of Sociology on\n\nBlackman\n\n352 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\ndeviance, yet neither Jenks nor Gelder provide detail about who, within the\nSchool, used subcultural theory. Furthermore, intoxicants are present as a\ntheme in the analysis, but with little special consideration. The subcultural\ndebate received further development in 2005 through the Journal of Youth\nStudies, which promoted the current debate with two papers, Blackman (2005)\nand Hesmondhalgh (2005), which put forward a critique of the postmodernist\nformulation of subcultural theory, although both papers had relatively little to\nsay about intoxicants. In contrast, two empirical studies on drugs and young\npeople, Lalander (2003) and Sandberg and Pedersen (2009), are supportive of\nsubculture as a tool for analysis to explain young people\u2019s substance consump-\ntion, but offer little on post-subculture or drug normalisation. Here, drug\nconsumption is explained within a traditional subcultural deviance framework.\n\nThree Different Theories of Subculture and Drugs\n\nIn Chilling Out (Blackman, 2004), I identified three major subcultural positions:\nstructural-functionalist, Marxist and postmodern, and discussed how each\ntheory of subculture created the opportunity to interpret the relationship\nbetween drugs and young people differently.\n\nTraditional theories of subculture; drugs, deviance and resistance\n\nThe American structural functionalist theory of subculture elaborated by\nA.K. Cohen (1956) was based on Durkheim\u2019s (1897) theory of anomie and\nMerton\u2019s (1938) theory of individual adaptation, combined with a Freudian\ntheory of the unconscious mind to consciously solve collective problems for\nworking-class youth who suffer from status frustration. Here, drug consump-\ntion is theorised as dysfunctional for the individual and thus for society. Drugs\nsubsequently became defined as a threat to the equilibrium of society (for\nexample, Cloward and Ohlin, 1960). This importation of American subcultural\ntheory into Britain remained unchallenged until Downes\u2019 (1966) critique and\nreassertion of the Chicago School normalcy of deviance within subcultural\nsettings.\n\nPhil Cohen first articulated the British theory of subculture in a paper\ndelivered to the CCCS in 1970. He removed the Freudian spring from the\nAmerican theory and replaced it with an Althusserian reading of the psycho-\nanalyst Jacques Lacan\u2019s concept of the imaginary. In Resistance Through\nRitual, Dick Hebdige and John Clarke (Hebdige, 1975 and Clarke, 1975) detail\nhow subcultures \u2018adopt a particular set of symbolic objects\u2019 and develop a\n\u2018group self-consciousness\u2019, which creates a \u2018stylistic fusion between object and\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n353r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\ngroup\u2019. In relation to drugs, Hebdige (1975, p. 89) states that, \u2018the mod had\nto be on the ball at all times, functioning at an emotional and intellectual\nfrequency high enough to pick up the slightest insult or joke or challenge or\nopportunity to make the most of the precious night. Thus speed was needed\nto keep mind and body synchronised perfectly\u2019. From here, Hebdige (1979,\np. 114) develops his reading of subculture where drugs are one feature among\nothers of a stylist practice of resistance. Hebdige (1979, p. 17) states that: \u2018The\nchallenge to hegemony which subcultures represent is not issued directly by\nthem. Rather it is expressed obliquely, in style\u2019. Subcultural style for Hebdige is\ninterpreted in isolation, away from the social context of its subcultural\npractitioners and performers. This analysis, and that of the CCCS, is based on\nan interpretation of subcultural style as a macro text. Little consideration is\ngiven to the interactional issues of lived relations; those whom Cohen (1972,\np. 24) called the \u2018bearers and supports of the subculture\u2019 (Blackman, 1995,\np. 22). The CCCS theory identifies drugs as an integral practice of subcultural\ngroupings, which is reminiscent of the Chicago School understanding of\ndeviance as a normal expression within an urban community. In this sense, we\ncan see that the initial work of the Chicago School, which saw deviance as a\nnormal response to social and economic constraints, became the foundation of\nthe CCCS theory, which enabled drugs to be interpreted not as a social problem\nbut as a signifier of subcultural identity and which would lead to Parker et al\u2019s\n(1998) \u2018drug normalisation thesis\u2019. I would suggest that the drug normalisation\ntheory is not a postmodern theory \u2013 it is derived from the ethnography-informed\nChicago School of Sociology, but it also required Cohen\u2019s (1972, p. 30) subcultural\nepistemological break, that it is \u2018important to make a distinction between\nsubculture and delinquency\u2019. Thus, it was the CCCS\u2019 theory of subculture, which\ncould explain drug use as a normalised \u2018recreational\u2019 part of a subculture\u2019s\nsignifying style. Separating subcultural activities from crime made it possible to\ninterpret drug use as non-deviant within the subculture.\n\nPostmodernism and post-subcultural theories\n\nThe postmodern theory of post-subculture is based on a critique of the CCCS\ntheory. However, before the 1990s, there had been a series of critiques of\nsubculture from within the CCCS (for example, Willis, 1972; McRobbie and\nGarber, 1975; Clarke, 1982) and also from Blackman (1995) and Thornton\n(1995). The source of the new criticism has been twofold. First, from the work\nof Steve Redhead, and second through the ideas developed by Michael\nMaffesoli, taken up by Andy Bennett and David Muggleton.\n\nRedhead\u2019s major contribution was to centrally locate drugs within the\nsubcultural debate. It is important to grasp that Redhead\u2019s argument against\n\nBlackman\n\n354 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nthe CCCS theory of subculture is a strategy to engage in other debates. In his\nefforts to establish the legitimacy of \u2018popular cultural studies\u2019 as a new discip-\nline, in opposition to what he terms \u2018unpopular cultural studies\u2019, Redhead\n(1995, p. 76) sampled Jean Baudrillard\u2019s thesis of the \u2018end of the social\u2019 to\ndismiss the CCCS radical tradition, discredit contemporary youth studies and\ncritique sociology in general. Redhead argues that sociology is too bound to\nmodernism, and that subcultures are a manifestation of social theory, which\nhas died because the social has become meaningless as a result of the extension\nof electronic global media. Subculture is theorised by Redhead, in his post-\nmodern worldview, as part of the emancipatory project developed by theorists\nbelonging to the past, and is thus to be discredited.\n\nIn detail, Redhead (1995:90) is virulent in his critique and hostile towards the\nacademic study of youth, stating that \u2018the decline of sociology of youth and\nsociology of deviance, as a discipline, and a genre of writing, is fast becoming a\ncliche\u0301\u2019, and that: \u2018Authentic subcultures were produced by subcultural theories,\nnot the other way round\u2019 (Redhead, 1990, p. 25). Although this critique has\nbeen broadly accepted (see Melechi, 1993; Miles, 1995; Muggleton, 1997;\nRietveld, 1998; Bennett, 1999, 2000; and Malbon, 1999), Greener and Hollands\n(2006, p. 413) have challenged Redhead\u2019s assertion to argue that rave culture is\nnot superficial but can possess a \u2018common set of values, and contains elements\nof a rather cohesive and homogenous culture\u2019. Further fuel for the subcultural\ndebate derives from Michael Maffesoli\u2019s The Time of the Tribes (1996), which is\nused as a new theoretical foundation by Muggleton (2000) and Bennett (1999)\nto construct a Neo-Weberian paradigm in opposition to the Marxist CCCS\ntheory of subculture. Bennett and Kahn-Harris (2004, p. 11) also advance\nMuggleton\u2019s ideas that subculture is \u2018redundant in relation to contemporary\nyouth culture\u2019. The postmodernist analysis is taken further by Muggleton\n(1997, 2000), who follows Redhead\u2019s interpretation of Baudrillard to assert\nthat subcultures are part of modernism. Muggleton (2000, pp. 47\u201349) defines\npost-subculturalists as revelling in choice \u2018no longer articulated around y the\nstructuring of class, gender or ethnicity\u2019. Thus, he understands subcultural\nidentity as \u2018free-floating signifiers\u2019 torn away from social structures. On this\nbasis, Muggleton (2000, p. 47) argues that \u2018there are no rules\u2019 for subcultural\nidentities, because, following Redhead\u2019s assertion, he claims that there are no\nauthentic subcultures. However, if you look at the visual case studies of the\nmods or punks presented by Muggleton (2000, pp. 97, 88, 148), each conform\nto subcultural regulations. Following on from Redhead, Muggleton develops\na stereotype of the CCCS approach labelled \u2018theoretical orthodoxy\u2019. This is\nreinforced by Muggleton and Weinzierl (2003, p. 7) in their criticism of the\nCCCS as possessing an \u2018explicitly political agenda\u2019. An earlier stereotype was\nproduced by Hargreaves and Hammersley (1982, p. 140), which claimed the\nCCCS \u2018response is to discharge vast quantities of superficially persuasive\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n355r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nrhetoric \u2013 a kind of CCCS \u201cgas\u201d as it were \u2013 which casts an imperceptible yet\nintellectually disabling cloud of dogmatism across the theoretical terrain\u2019.\nMuggleton (2000, p. 42) argues that the CCCS were working with an\n\u2018emancipatory meta-narrative\u2019 with a \u2018totalising conception\u2019.\n\nThe criticism that certain postmodern studies overlook the social and\neconomic context of young people\u2019s lives away from the subculture echoes\nAngela McRobbie\u2019s (1991, p. 19) criticism that \u2018few writers seemed interested\nin what happened when a mod went home after a weekend on speed. Only what\nhappened on the streets mattered\u2019. The issue of realism is picked up by\nShildrick and MacDonald (2006, p. 129), who argue that there has been\n\u2018marginality of questions of class and other forms of structural inequality in the\nmaking and meaning of youth cultural identity and experience\u2019. This is\nsupported by Nayak and Kehily (2008, p. 13) who state that: \u2018these recent\nstudies of youth culture appear to elide matters of social class and offer little\ncommentary about new social divisions\u2019. Shildrick and MacDonald (2006,\np. 128) further accuse postmodern theorists for neglecting \u2018ordinary youth and\nthose who are economically disadvantaged in favour of middle class youth\nfocused on music and style\u2019 (also see Hollands, 2002; MacDonald and Marsh,\n2005; Nayak, 2006; Pilkington, 2006). They call for theoretical refinement and\nempirical renewal to retain the concept of subculture and oppose those\ntheorists who maintain the concept should be \u2018dumped\u2019 (2005, p. 129). Moore\n(2004) sees subculture as relevant to studying drug problem groups, while he\nasserts that it should be \u2018retired\u2019 from the study of recreational drug\nconsumers. In an attempt to forge a new position or a compromise, Greener\nand Hollands (2006, p. 413) see theoretical value in both \u2018traditional subcul-\ntures and postmodern approaches towards youth culture\u2019.\n\nSubcultures, music, pleasure, resistance and postcoloniality\n\nThe postmodern theory of post subculture links resistance with pleasure,\narguing that subculture is understood in terms of hedonism as a new form of\nself-expression. Rietveld (1998, p. 195) and Melechi\u2019s (1993, pp. 32\u201333) theory\nof subculture \u2013 as an \u2018act of disappearance\u2019 \u2013 is achieved by exchanging\nBaudrillard\u2019s ideas on the \u2018ecstasy of communication\u2019 with the ecstasy of drug\nconsumption in subculture. Melechi and Rietveld\u2019s theory of subculture is\ncausally linked to the use of drugs to achieve intoxication to experience a\ntrance-like condition, combined with Baudrillard\u2019s (1988) notion of artificiality\nand the meaningless superficiality of post-tourism. Wilson (2006, p. 159) is\ncritical of those studies that take a postmodern approach as being too\npreoccupied, and claims that they \u2018overstate\u2019 what young people gain from the\nrave experience \u2013 for example, that ravers \u2018lose themselves in order to find\n\nBlackman\n\n356 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nthemselves\u2019. This is supported by Nayak and Kehily (2008, p. 13) who argue\nthat: \u2018A feature of post modern approaches to youth culture is a tendency to\nproduce rich and aesthetically pleasing accounts of young people at play at the\nexpense of some earlier subcultural themes\u2019.\n\nIn relation to dance culture, Malbon (1999), Jackson (2004) and also Rief\n(2009) all follow similar paths focused on drugs in their studies of young\npeople, following a non-deviant drug-taking perspective. Although neither\nMalbon nor Jackson makes any connection with the normalisation thesis and\nits link with postmodernism, Rief does link drug normalisation with the\nconcept of tribe. Malbon\u2019s work is parallel to Pini (1997, p. 281) in the sense\nthat she is similarly preoccupied with the physicality of the pleasure of the\ndance floor linked to intoxication. The idea of rave as a form of resistance\nwithin the development of self reflection has a parallel with the ideas put\nforward by Rietveld (1998) and Melechi (1993). Although keen to focus on\nsociality, Malbon and Pini ignore the social relations of club culture and rave\nsubculture. As a result, Malbon fails to place drug consumption within the\npolitical context of state control and also ignores the fact that club culture has\nconsistently and incestuously celebrated drugs as a form of resistance to\nauthority (Collin, 1997; Blackman, 2004). The form that this resistance takes\nmay be contradictory, and even superficial, but the fact cannot be escaped that\nthe dance-rave subculture has a history of revolt, even where there have been\nattempts to turn this pleasurable revolt into support for the dominant culture\nsuch as through mainstream tourism and leisure (Mckay, 1998). Malbon is\nhighly critical of the theorisation of youth culture representing or expressing\nresistance, preferring to stay within localised cultural analysis focusing on the\npolitics of subjectivity. A key feature of Malbon, Rief and Jackson\u2019s studies is\nthe centrality of dancing and a presentation of their research subjects\u2019\ninterpretation of their drug consumption as reflecting the everyday context and\nparticipation within a dance subculture. Rather than employing the concept of\nsubculture, Jackson is drawn towards the work of Bourdieu on habitus and\nlooks to Foucault and Goffman to add more focus on the use of the body\nwithin a subculture. Jackson\u2019s (2004, p. 159) approach is influenced by post-\nmodernism (Lyotard and Baudrillard) but he has little time for Maffesoli or the\nideas of Redhead, which play a more significant role in Malbon\u2019s study.\nAlthough music plays a key role in Jackson\u2019s study, for him it is the physicality\nof clubbing that unites participants in their search for heightened pleasurable\nintoxication.\n\nWithin popular music studies, the term scene is used in contrast to subculture\nto describe developments in musical genres, impacting on communities within\nthe relationship between the audience and musician. Leading advocates Straw\n(1991) and Shanks (1994) have different understandings of the term, but seek\nto apply the concept in a manner that offers agency. Hesmondhalgh supports\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n357r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nthis idea (though admits the term is \u2018confusing\u2019 and \u2018plagued by difficulties\u2019),\nand maintains that: \u2018The concept of scene is richer, provides new under-\nstandings of musical collectivities in relation to space and place, and offers\ninsights into the formation of aesthetic communities in modern urban life\u2019\n(2005, pp. 23, 30, 38). It is in this sense that Anderson (2009, p. 14) applies\nthe term scene to describe rave culture operating as a collective where drug\nuse is a major part within the different international dance communities\nshe observed. However, she also uses the concept of subculture quite freely,\nand her treatment of drug normalisation remains underdeveloped. The central\nfocus remains on the criminalisation of rave culture as a form of recreation\n(Measham and Moore, 2009). The focus on rave as a non-deviant practice,\nwhere drug consumption is one factor among others, makes her international\nstudy align with Hammersley et al\u2019s (2002) micro-focused study in the United\nKingdom. In opposition to Redhead and other post subculturalists, young\npeople in the Anderson and Hammersley et al studies are part of a family\nculture and wider community. They take part in normal social aspirations and\nsee rave as meaningful.\n\nA problem faced by the subcultural debate, according to Greener and\nHollands (2006, p. 415), is the extent that it is \u2018UK based, if not western in its\norientation\u2019. This argument is more rigoursly pursued by Huq (2006, p. 25)\nthrough her assertion that we live in a \u2018postcolonial world\u2019. She states that\nthe \u2018CCCS treatments of ethnicity were largely confined to white objectifica-\ntion of African Caribbean style\u2019 (ibid, p. 33), and correctly identifies the CCCS\nneglect of Asian youth, except for where they are victims of racism. At the\nsame time, little attention has been given to racial formation and ethnic\nidentities within the post subculturalist studies. Lipsitz (1994, p. 110) sees the\nproblem of Hebdige\u2019s analysis of race and subculture as disguising the\ncontradictions of \u2018blocked class politics\u2019 and as offering \u2018no autonomous\nidentity\u2019, dialogue or creativity for young Black and Asian youth. Back (1996)\ndemonstrates the lack of attention given to ethnic identities, and through\nhis work alongside that of Huq (2006) shows that Black and Asian youth\nculture research is now more common (Mahendru, 2010). Gilroy (1987, 1993)\nhas for some time offered corrections to the subcultural tradition and put\nBlack representation at the centre of youth cultural politics, and this has been\nbuilt upon through an expansion of hip hop studies including Rose (1994),\nMitchell (1996), Gidley (2007) and Bradley (2009). For example, Dedman\u2019s\n(2010) approach is to support the concept of subculture, arguing that young\npeople\u2019s involvement in grime subculture shows active cultural and musical\nproduction. Gunter\u2019s (2010) ethnographic study on young Black men within\nschool, and as part of \u2018hanging out\u2019 on the \u2018road culture\u2019, uses the concept of\nsubculture to explore aspects of what he calls deviant \u2018badness\u2019. He also\ninterprets young people\u2019s everyday activities within a naturalistic perspective\n\nBlackman\n\n358 r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nderived from Matza\u2019s understanding of the Chicago School, and sees no\nrelevance in the term post subculture (even though his study is about the\nappropriation of new spaces by Black youth). For Nayak and Kehily (2008,\np. 27), the development of global culture and the production of new spaces\nfor young people is where cultural hybridity can act to create modes of resis-\ntance. However, they also urge caution and cite Stuart Hall (1996, p. 248) to\nremind us that colonialism is not dead, poverty remains and young people\nsuffer across the global from basic malnutrition. Furthermore, the notion of\nmulticulturalism according to France et al (2007, p. 310) has tended to \u2018show\nlittle acknowledgement or recognition of the role of youth culture\u2019, and as a\nresult, where Black and Asian youth culture feature as part of a multicultural\nyouth culture, they suggest that there has been a tendency to see such group-\nings as dangerous and subject to criminalisation (Alexander, 2000).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe aim of recent British governments has been to construct drug prohibition\nas a popular preventive with assistance from a tabloid media to reinforce\nnegative messages against specialist government advisors (Nutt), the reclassi-\nfication of cannabis and criminal control of \u2018legal highs\u2019. A contradiction\nbehind this punitive response is that we have seen growth in the use of drug\nimagery within mainstream capitalism to market products of corporate\ncompanies. At the same time, a critical issue within drug prohibition has been\nthe questioning within newspapers, both in the United States and the United\nKingdom, of the effectiveness of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 policy, alongside television\ncoverage of the related human rights abuses in different states. Furthermore,\npopular drug tourism, decriminalisation policies, the diversity of drug products\nand messages available within the internet, along with capital investment by\ngovernment into research on the medical use of cannabis, have contributed to a\nlegitimation crisis in drug prohibition.\n\nThe apparent failure of prohibition has been amplified by the concept of\ndrug normalisation. Prohibition has created the context for a popular preven-\ntive, but at the same time the failure of prohibition has created a legitimation\ncrisis. In popular culture, we see the image of Western youth at play under-\ntaking recreational drug consumption, but this does not fit easily alongside\nevidence of corrupt and brutal regimes, police and governments. As a concept,\ndrug normalisation explains the patterns of substance consumption by sets\nof young people and reinvigorates critical interpretation of the relation\nbetween drugs within the legitimate and illegitimate economy. The mainstream\neconomy from the nineteenth century opium trade to the contemporary\nglobalisation of intoxicants through rave culture demonstrates that drugs are a\n\nYouth subcultures, normalisation and drug prohibition\n\n359r 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd. 1746-918X British Politics Vol. 5, 3, 337\u2013366\n\n\n\nlucrative commodity, irrespective of the law. Significantly, the concept of drug\nnormalisation allows young people\u2019s use of intoxicants to be described in terms\nwhich are not pathological, but relate to their cultural recreation. The concept\npromotes agency by allowing subjects to speak about their patterns of\nconsumption away from deficit theory and in relation to cultural production\nand meaning. It has been argued that the Chicago School approach, combined\nwith the CCCS theory of subculture, has enabled normalisation theory to\naccount for young people\u2019s drug use as a non-deviant expression of their\nsubculture.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI thank Howard Becker, Fiona Measham, two of my PhD students, Cara\nRobinson and Todd Dedman, the reviewers and editors of the journal British\nPolitics, and especially Debbie Cox.\n\nNotes\n\n1 See, for example: Drugs and Role Models in Sport: Making and Setting Examples (2003-2004);\n\nDrug Education in Schools: An Update, September (2000, p. 9) (both OFSTED).
