During this \ntime of life, young people experience enormous changes due to physical matura-\ntion, which is accompanied by cognitive, social/emotional, and interpersonal \nchanges. It is a period when the influence of parents and families gradually \ndiminishes and the influence of external factors, such as peers; the media; the \neducational environment; and, more generally, the economic, social, and cultural \nenvironments in which they live, are increasingly prominent (Spano 2004).\n\nThe study of the process of maturing and becoming an adult in the sociode-\nmographic literature has typically focused on a number of key transitions, \nincluding the establishment of romantic partnerships, sexual initiation, com-\npleting school and entering the job market, leaving the family home, entering \ninto marriage and parenthood, and, for some, migrating to cities or across \ninternational borders (Ju\u00e1rez et al. 2008; Grant and Furstenberg 2007; Lloyd \n2005). These events are interrelated and are affected by many variables at the \nfamily, community, national, and international levels, including the poverty and \nvulnerability that are part of the lives of many young people in low-income \ncountries. The pathways to adulthood that occur over these short years\u2014some \npurposefully chosen and others imposed by families or society\u2014greatly affect \nyoung people\u2019s future lives. These pathways vary considerably across and within \nsocieties.\n\nFor many adolescents living in the developing world or with origins in devel-\noping countries, the migration experience, both within and across country \nboundaries, is an integral part of the transition to adulthood. Migration of chil-\ndren and youths has long occurred as part of a collective family strategy in search \nof educational and apprenticeship opportunities and, in some parts of the world, \nfor child fosterage (uNFPA 2006). In countries where early marriage patterns \npredominate, girls have often migrated at young ages to join their promised hus-\nband\u2019s family. Seasonal labor migration of young unmarried men, both internally \nand internationally, is common in many parts of the world, and short- and \nmedium-term labor migration has become more frequent for young women as \nwell. In addition, many adolescents are the children of migrants and are living \ntheir youth in social environments that are often distant from the environments \nthat their parents experienced at their same age with respect to culture, lan-\nguage, religion, legal status, and normative behaviors.\n\nWhile migration literature is abundant, including many theories and extensive \nsubstantive findings (Massey et al. 1993; Arango 2000; White and Lindstrom \n2005; Collinson et al. 2009), there has been little research on the migration of \nyouths in the context of other transitions to adulthood. The paucity of research is \ndue, at least in part, to difficulties in obtaining longitudinal data that track migra-\ntion while simultaneously following other transitions. Traditional microeconomic \ntheories of labor migration are predicated on assumptions of free choice and \neconomic rationality. The decision-maker is presumed to be an adult. Individuals \nare assumed to desire to maximize their well-being in a context of uncertainty: \nthey consider the costs and benefits of moving to different places and the related \n\n\n\n8  The ANNALS OF The AMerICAN ACADeMY\n\nrisks most often in terms of economic factors\u2014income and unemployment in \nparticular. The \u201cnew economics of migration\u201d theory (Stark and Bloom 1985) has \nexpanded these traditional frameworks to incorporate family migration strategies \nas part of efforts to diversify sources of income and limit uncertainty.\n\nThe nature and welfare consequences of youth migration are distinct from \nthose of other age groups, as the migration event overlaps with many other transi-\ntions, including transitions to work, sexual maturation, marriage and childbear-\ning, and citizenship. Migration adds another layer of complexity to the conditions \nof entry into adulthood, including a changed social and physical environment and \noften reduced oversight and guidance from kin and communities with respect to \nyoung people\u2019s behaviors, resulting in changes in attitudes, aspirations, and \nbehaviors. Migration brings new opportunities and freedom from traditional cul-\ntural constraints\u2014factors that may be especially important for young women. \nIndeed, with regard to permanent long-distance family migrations, parents fre-\nquently speak of the move as both a personal sacrifice and an investment in their \nchildren\u2019s well-being by way of better schooling and subsequent employment \nopportunities. On the other hand, the new living environment is also a source of \nvulnerability, often with less family and social support during a period of life that \nis already characterized by risk-taking and psychological stress, and a greater \nlikelihood of abuse and exploitation.\n\nrapid changes in the contemporary world are further affecting migration pat-\nterns at the local, national, and international levels, with important consequences \nfor young people. Globalization, mass media, the Internet, and higher levels of \neducation have combined to alter young people\u2019s expectations and attitudes, \nreducing traditional influences and plausibly leading to larger and more diversi-\nfied flows of migration during adolescence and young adulthood. On the other \nhand, the evolving international context (e.g., restrictions that developed coun-\ntries have placed on immigration) and local situations (e.g., the sustained eco-\nnomic recession in African countries that has limited the absorptive capacity of \nsome labor markets and reduced families\u2019 abilities to finance moves) have con-\nstrained some migration flows.\n\nThe effects of migration on youths\u2019 transitions are hard to generalize, given the \nhuge diversity of situations in which they occur. Do young people move with their \nfamilies, within well-organized frameworks that provide adequate oversight to \ntheir activities and assistance when necessary, or as individuals who are largely \ncut off from their families and friends? To what extent are the migrations the \nresult of their own decisions or that of others, and to what degree are their needs \nand aspirations taken into account during or after the move? Are the motivations \nunderlying migrations economic in nature, for marriage, in response to external \nevents such as civil wars, because of political persecution or environmental crises, \nor due to exploitation and trafficking? And at what age do the migrations occur, \nas physical and emotional maturity, and thus the ability to deal with new situa-\ntions and adversity, surely differ greatly between a 14-year-old teenager and a \n22-year-old young adult?\n\n\n\nYOuTh MIGrATION AND ADOLeSCeNCe 9\n\nThe Seminar That Led to This Volume\n\nThe Scientific Panel on Adolescent Life Course in Developing Countries of the \nInternational union for the Scientific Study of Population (IuSSP) organized an \ninternational seminar on Youth Migration and Transitions to Adulthood in \nDeveloping Countries in December 2010 to bring together researchers and \nexperts on adolescent migration.1 The main goal of the seminar was to examine \nyouth migration and its consequences for the various other transitions to adult-\nhood, including reproductive outcomes and educational, employment, and mari-\ntal outcomes; and the specific strategies underlying migration and its consequences. \nA better understanding of these issues is urgently needed if we are to develop \nmore effective policies and interventions that target the welfare of youth migrants \nfrom developing countries. A second goal was to stimulate more research on this \nlittle-studied topic and to heighten researchers\u2019 and policymakers\u2019 awareness of \nthese issues. The twenty-four papers presented at the seminar looked at different \ntypes of migration in a broad variety of developing country contexts. Issues of \nyouth empowerment and gender differences were recurrent themes in many of \nthe papers.\n\nThis volume of The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social \nScience includes twelve of the studies that represent new empirical evidence on \na range of topics presented at the seminar and for which there currently exists \nvery limited or no knowledge. The articles vary greatly in their methodological \napproaches and the type of migration examined\u2014internal or international, short \nterm or long term, with or without accompanying parents. Some researchers \nconducted secondary analysis of survey data while others collected their own \nquantitative data. The models used in the empirical analysis included multilevel \nmodeling, logistic regressions, and event history analysis, among others. Some \nresearchers employed qualitative approaches to collect information using in-\ndepth interviews alone or jointly with focus groups and participant observation, \nand one used a mixed-method approach. The different methodological approaches \nwere chosen according to the objectives of the research, and together they pro-\nvide a wealth of information for better understanding youth migration and \nyouths\u2019 transitions to adulthood. The qualitative methodologies based on the \nnarratives of those interviewed provide insight into people\u2019s values, attitudes, and \nbehaviors (the \u201cwhy\u201d), while the articles that used quantitative approaches use \nstatistical associations and significance to describe and analyze the migration \ncondition and the transitions to adulthood process. There has been a wide discus-\nsion in the literature on the transition to adulthood about the importance of age \nin the analysis (Dixon-Mueller 2008; Lloyd 2005). These articles also vary in \nrespect to the age groups examined, with some using their own definitions of \nadolescence and youth depending on the topic being addressed, while others use \nthe more standard 15\u201324 age group.\n\nThe articles can be classified into three themes: (1) migration in the context of \ntransitions to adulthood, including schooling, employment, and family formation; \n\n\n\n10  The ANNALS OF The AMerICAN ACADeMY\n\n(2) consequences of migration for health, reproductive outcomes, and childbear-\ning; and (3) migration strategies and consequences. All the articles presented \nhere are innovative in their approach, and their findings advance our understand-\ning of youths\u2019 migration and transitions to adulthood in developing countries.\n\nMigration in the context of transitions to adulthood\n\neach of the five articles included in this section uses an innovative approach \nto explore several transitions simultaneously. Four articles on Mexico, Malawi, \nChina, and Indonesia are quantitative, while the fifth article is based on qualita-\ntive evidence from Mexicans in the united States. The two articles that look at \nMexico focus on international migration, while the articles on Malawi, China, and \nIndonesia deal with internal migration.\n\nThe study by rene zenteno, Silvia Giorguli, and edith Guti\u00e9rrez examines \nexisting theories of international migration and concludes that they have failed to \ndistinguish age-related variations. The article examines how migration motiva-\ntions vary depending on the stage in the life course, particularly during the youth-\nto-adult transition among adolescent men and women migrating to the united \nStates. The authors estimate discrete-time hazard models using retrospective life \nhistory data from the Mexican Migration Project. A key finding of the article is \nthat the migration process operates differently in adolescence than it does later \nin the life course. The article also examines how adolescent migration is influ-\nenced by other major markers of the transition to adulthood, such as education, \nlabor force experience, and family formation.\n\nThe article from Kathleen Beegle and Michelle Poulin investigates the rela-\ntionship among major life events, household characteristics, and migration \namong adolescents and young adults in Malawi. using two years of panel data \n(2007 and 2009) from the Marriage Transitions Survey in Malawi, designed to \nexplore socioeconomic and demographic aspects of youth transitions to adult-\nhood, the authors find important gender differences in migration patterns among \nadolescents and young adults. While migrations during youth are common in the \ncountry, young women are found to be significantly more likely to migrate than \nare young men. Although a quarter of men reported moving for work-related \nreasons, the predominant reasons for migration for both genders are, nonethe-\nless, noneconomic. A woman typically moves because of marriage or just after \nmarrying, and her migration is more likely to be influenced by school attendance \nand wealth than by age per se, a pattern different from that observed in the past. \nIn addition, the authors report that closer ties to the head of the household are \nassociated with less mobility for both young women and men.\n\nJuhua Yang\u2019s article addresses the important topic of social exclusion of young \nrural-urban migrants in China. using the 2005 National One Percent Population \nSurvey data, she applies multilevel models to examine the characteristics and \ncorrelates of migrants\u2019 socioeconomic integration. her results indicate that young \nrural-urban migrants achieve lower socioeconomic outcomes when compared to \n\n\n\nYOuTh MIGrATION AND ADOLeSCeNCe 11\n\nlocal (nonmigrant) youths and to urban-urban migratory youth. Young migrants \ncoming from rural areas are less likely to obtain employment positions that pro-\nvide high incomes, better social benefits, and housing subsidies\u2014resources that \nare mainly reserved for local urban residents. She concludes that the potentially \nbeneficial effects of migration on personal development and economic success \nare compromised by institutional barriers that exclude migrants from rural areas \nand, to a lesser degree, other outsiders, particularly youths, from succeeding in \ncity life.\n\nThe article by Ariane utomo, Anna reimondos, Iwu Dwisetyani utomo, Peter \nMcDonald, and Terrence hull examines the impact of internal migration and its \ntiming on young women\u2019s transitions to adulthood in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. \nThe authors use data from the 2010 Greater Jakarta Transition to Adulthood \nSurvey to explore the timing of five key adulthood markers: leaving the parental \nhome, leaving school, entering the workforce, marrying, and having children. \nSpecially, they investigate the role of variations in education, marriage, and fertil-\nity patterns in explaining migrant and nonmigrant women\u2019s current employment \noutcomes. To provide a deeper insight into migration motivations and the life \nstrategies that these women adopt to navigate their transitions to adulthood, they \ncomplement their statistical analysis with qualitative data from a series of in-\ndepth interviews.\n\nFinally, Georgina rojas-Garc\u00eda uses a qualitative approach to examine the \nprocess through which \u201cGeneration 1.5\u201d Mexican student-migrants to the united \nStates manage to obtain a college education in the united States and the uncer-\ntainty that surrounds their future careers. These young adults were born in \nMexico and taken to the united States by their parents in their formative years. \nThe analysis shows that, despite often being poor and vulnerable, young illegal \nimmigrants can be high achievers in the academic arena, although their subse-\nquent employment prospects are limited due to their legal status. She finds that \nenrollment in a higher education institution does not alter the students\u2019 official \nmigration status or increase their chances of obtaining citizenship or residency. \nTheir situation could thus be characterized as \u201cqualified but excluded,\u201d as their \nexistence as residents is not legally recognized.\n\nConsequences of migration for health,  \nreproductive outcomes, and childbearing\n\nThis subsection contains three empirical studies that use data from India, \nKenya, and a cross-section of sub-Saharan African countries. By contrast with the \nfirst set of articles, these articles show the negative consequences of youth migra-\ntion on reproductive health outcomes.\n\nThe study by rajib Acharya, K. G. Santhya, and Shireen Jejeebhoy provides \nvaluable evidence for the relationship between unmarried young people\u2019s migra-\ntion experiences during adolescence and young adulthood and their sexual \nbehaviors in India. using multivariate logistic regression models, their findings \n\n\n\n12  The ANNALS OF The AMerICAN ACADeMY\n\nshow that migrant youths are more likely than others to experience romantic \nrelationships and initiate sex before marriage. Moreover, among the sexually \nexperienced, young men who had migrated are more likely than others to report \nhaving had multiple sexual partners. Their study contributes to the body of litera-\nture on population mobility and its relationship to the sexual behavior of young \npeople, a subject for which information is scarce in India.\n\nThe article from hongwei Xu, Blessing Mberu, rachel Goldberg, and Nancy \nLuke investigates how the timing and frequency of rural-to-urban moves in \nKenya are associated with premarital pregnancy. using event history methods, \ntheir results show a higher risk of premarital pregnancy among migrants than \nnonmigrants. Their study employs a novel survey instrument called the \n\u2018\u2018relationship history Calendar\u2019\u2019 (rhC) from the urban Life among Youth in \nKisumu Project conducted in 2007. This study is one of the first to adopt a life \ncourse approach to investigate how multiple dimensions of the rural-to-urban \nmigration experience act to hasten or delay the event of premarital pregnancy. \nThe authors conclude that migration incurs or enhances specific risks for youth, \ncreating a greater need for sexual and reproductive health education services, \nservices that should be made available to new urban residents.\n\nMonica Magadi\u2019s study examines migration as a risk factor for hIV infections \namong youths in sub-Saharan Africa. Taking into account country- and regional-\nlevel variations, she estimates multilevel models using the youth samples of the \nDemographic and health Surveys from nineteen countries in the region, con-\nducted between 2003 and 2008. her results suggest that young migrants are \nmore vulnerable to contracting hIV compared to nonmigrants. however, the \nhigher risks observed for migrants are, to a large extent, explained by differences \nin their background demographic and socioeconomic factors. In particular, \nmigrants are more likely to be older, to have been married, or to live in urban \nareas, all of which are associated with higher risks of hIV. her article also high-\nlights the vulnerability of orphans and ever-married young female migrants, call-\ning for further research to better understand the underlying mechanisms for \nincreased risk among these specific subgroups.\n\nMigration strategies and consequences\n\nIn the last section, which contains four qualitative studies from West \nAfrica\u2014two from Mali, one from Mauritania, and one from Senegal. Claudine \nSauvain-Dugerdil explores the impact of unprecedented individual youth \nmobility among the Sarny\u00e9r\u00e9 Dogon in Mali. She asks whether youth migration \nacts as a mitigating factor to cope with new uncertainties in contemporary life \nor whether it is instead a dimension of ongoing social disintegration. She finds \nthat youth mobility, especially that of girls, is a new phenomenon because it is \ngrounded primarily in individual rather than collective (family) strategies. \nAlthough these migrations are typically short term and occur over relatively \nshort distances, they provide precious alternatives to local work and life in this \n\n\n\nYOuTh MIGrATION AND ADOLeSCeNCe 13\n\nagricultural subsistence setting. however, whereas economic reasons underpin \nboys\u2019 moves, for young unmarried girls the predominant driving force for \nmigrations is to discover the outside world. Sauvain-Dugerdil finds that, in \nregard to intergenerational relations, there is a delicate redistribution of power \nthat is occurring within the society. real generational conflicts seem to be \navoided, however, thanks to the realism of the older generations, which are \nresigned to the fact that \u201ctimes are changing.\u201d\n\nThe study by V\u00e9ronique hertrich and Marie Lesclingand investigates the \nchallenge to gender and intergenerational relationships of adolescent migration \nin rural Mali. In the context under study, most adolescents engage in labor \nmigration, which occurs mainly within the country or to neighboring countries. \nThe article examines the experiences, expectations, and perceptions of adoles-\ncent migration from different perspectives and takes into account gender and \ngeneration. Their findings reveal that expectations are very different for the two \ngenders: adolescent boys use migration to strengthen their status within the \nfamily, while adolescent girls express strong expectations in terms of learning. \nYoung men\u2019s labor mobility has developed in line with family strategies and is \nperceived positively by local society. Conversely, the growth of labor migration \namong adolescent girls has developed independently of family projects and \ncaters to more personal desires. The authors conclude that, for young girls, \nmigration increases self-esteem and opens the range of possibilities for their \nadult lives.\n\nThe article by Fabienne Tanon and Abdoulaye Sow examines a set of issues \nrelated to risky and illegal unaccompanied youth migration from Mauritania to \neurope, which is strongly encouraged by the positive cultural perception of \nemigrants in Mauritanian society. The authors find that youths\u2019 desire to \nenhance their social prestige is the main reason for migration, and therefore, the \n\u201cmigrant\u201d embodies a new emblematic figure of success whose social visibility is \nundeniable. The authors argue that any discourse urging adolescents to remain \nin their home country (with the exception of the firstborn son) is de facto in \ncontradiction with the fundamental pillars of the society. Their analysis is sup-\nported by a rich reflection on the nature of local culture and on historical devel-\nopments, in which the idealized role of migrants is grounded, highlighting the \nenormous challenge of designing policy that could effectively halt high-risk \nyouth migration to europe.\n\nThe last article, by Nathalie Mondain, Alioune Diagne, and Sara randall, \nbrings a qualitative perspective to the transitory phase of life that european \nmigration represents to many young Senegalese men. The authors\u2019 research \nreveals a complex picture of the situations of prospective and current emigrants \nin the study site, and of relations of reciprocity and solidarity within the kin \nnetwork. They find that predominant motivations to emigrate are related to the \nsocial prestige associated with being viewed as a successful migrant and to the \nobligation young people feel toward their elders to provide them with the means \nto live out their old age in the best conditions. In line with this idea of \n\n\n\n14  The ANNALS OF The AMerICAN ACADeMY\n\nintergenerational responsibilities, they also report that most emigrants require \nthe support of their elders to fund their migration, thus reinforcing their feelings \nof obligation toward them.\n\nTo conclude, these studies and their findings clearly attest to the enormous \ndiversity of situations of youth migration, transitions to adulthood, and the con-\ntexts in which they occur. For some adolescents and young adults, migration \nbrings with it very serious risks and often negative consequences, while for others \nit opens horizons and is associated with expanding opportunities in both the \nsocial and economic spheres. Factors that influence the nature of the migration \nand its outcome include the young person\u2019s age at the time of the move, whether \nthe migration occurred alone or within the framework of the family, and the \nactivities and living conditions of the young migrant at the place of destination. \nWe hope that these articles will encourage others to pursue research in this \nimportant and largely neglected area, work that is of great value to better under-\nstand the stakes involved in youth migration and to inform policy to address the \nneeds of these often vulnerable youth.\n\nNote\n1.
