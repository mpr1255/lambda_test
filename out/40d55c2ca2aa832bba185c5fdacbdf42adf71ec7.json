INTRODUCTION\n\nFIVE years after the Lehman collapse, an exit from very low interest rates and accommo-\n\ndative monetary policy in the advanced economies seems a rather long-term project that\n\nis hard to manoeuvre and subject to controversial discussions. On the one side, there are econ-\n\nomists that stress the need for a prolonged period of low interest rates and monetary expan-\n\nsion to stabilise financial markets, to step up growth or to help finance high levels of\n\ngovernment debt (e.g. Bernanke, 2010; Blanchard et al., 2010; Summers, 2013). On the other\n\nside, there are economists that warn of unintended distortions caused by the low interest rate\n\nenvironment that may actually impede the recovery of the economy (e.g. McKinnon, 2009;\n\nWhite, 2012).\n\nWhichever side of the discussion may finally call itself the winner, it is widely recognised\n\nthat the low interest rate policy has implications beyond the advanced economies (e.g. Portes,\n\n2012; Reinhart, 2013; Sanchez, 2013). This paper outlines the unintended consequences of the\n\nprolonged period of very low interest rates in emerging markets. The paper is informed by a\n\nMises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom view and Mises\u2019 (1929) law of unintended consequences.\n\nIn line with the theory, the paper suggests that even though very low interest rates may be\n\njustified by policy goals in advanced economies, in today\u2019s integrated world financial system,\n\nthey are associated with unintended destabilising financial flows to the emerging market econ-\n\nomies. As suggested by Mises\u2019s law (1929), the unintended consequences of low interest\n\nrates, such as inflationary pressure and risk of capital flow reversals in emerging markets, pro-\n\nvide incentives for further policy actions. Since 2009, emerging market policymakers have\n\nincreasingly tried to isolate their economies from financial inflows using repressive policy\n\nmeasures. Overall, recent developments seem to match the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS view.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is as follows. I begin with an introduction of what I call the\n\nMises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom perspective (Section 2). This sets the stage for a discussion of\n\nthe impact of the low interest rate environment on emerging market economies. In Section 3,\n\nI apply the credit boom view to detect unintended consequences of the prolonged period of\n\nvery low interest rates since 2009 in emerging markets. I show that financial flows to emerg-\n\ning markets have accelerated and credit bubbles have started to swell in the aftermath of the\n\nfinancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, given that emerging market business cycles have decoupled\n\nfrom those in the advanced world.\n\nI maintain that, in a world of very low interest rates, emerging markets are under pressure\n\nto follow the interest rate policy of the large economies. Policy autonomy is undermined and\n\nI thank an anonymous referee and the editor of this journal for very useful suggestions that helped sub-\nstantially improve the paper. Further I would like thank Edward Chancellor (GMO Investment), John\nCochrane (MS University of Denver), Enrico Colombatto (Turin University, ICER), Mario Rizzo (New\nYork University), Joseph Salerno (Pace University) and Gunther Schnabl (University of Leipzig) for\ninsightful discussions on the topic, encouragement and valuable support.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd 1367\n\nThe World Economy (2014)\ndoi: 10.1111/twec.12199\n\nThe World Economy\n\n\n\ninflationary pressure hard to fight unless capital controls are installed. Therefore, consistent\n\nwith Mises\u2019s law of unintended consequences, Section 4 provides evidence that this policy\n\ndilemma has triggered a new wave of interventionist policies in the emerging markets as poli-\n\ncymakers have returned to financial repression to stem volatile capital inflows. As a conse-\n\nquence, past trends in financial openness have reversed in many emerging markets. Section 5\n\nconcludes.\n\n2. MONETARY POLICY AND CREDIT BOOMS\n\na. The Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS Credit Boom Theory\n\nThe Mises\u2013Hayek or \u2018Austrian\u2019 business cycle theory was originally developed to pro-\n\nvide an explanation of the credit boom of the 1920s and 1930s that led to the Great\n\nDepression (Young, 2012). The original theory is widely recognised to have problems in\n\nexplaining the depth or severity of recessions, as well as flaws in its theoretical core. There-\n\nfore, it should not be considered a general theory of the credit cycle (without some serious\n\nupdating; Sraffa, 1932; Laidler, 2003; Young, 2012).1 The Mises\u2013Hayek view of crisis\n\nevents as the result of an unsustainable \u2018credit booms gone bust\u2019, however, is still appealing\n\nto many economists.\n\nIn particular, economists at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) have repeatedly\n\nwarned of the emergence of dangerous asset and credit booms in the run-up to recent financial\n\ncrises (Borio and Lowe, 2002; White, 2006; Borio, 2008). Consequently, White (2009) finds\n\nthat much can be learned from, for example, the older Austrian view, and Borio and Disyatat\n\n(2011) broadly outline a somewhat modernised credit boom view that gives credit to the Aus-\n\ntrians and is by and large compatible with their original theory.\n\nSince the 2000s, the credit boom view that is based on the writings of the Austrians and\n\nthe BIS economists has gained attention from academics (e.g. Oppers, 2002; Eichengreen and\n\nMitchener, 2003). With the bursting of the housing bubble, even the original Austrian view\n\nhas seen a renaissance (Ferguson, 2009), as it seems to provide some understanding of the\n\nbuilding of the US subprime market bubble (Leijonhufvud, 2009; O\u2019Driscoll, 2009; Salerno,\n\n2012) as well as of recent developments and crises in emerging markets (Hoffmann, 2010;\n\nHoffmann and Schnabl, 2011; Cachanosky, 2014). Further, in line with the Mises\u2013Hayek and\n\nBIS view, a growing number of econometric studies relate financial crises to preceding credit\n\nbooms and periods of low interest rates (e.g. Jorda et al., 2011, 2013; Bordo and Meissner,\n\n2012; Schularick and Taylor 2012).\n\nIn the following, I outline a credit boom theory that is based on the writings of the Austri-\n\nans and the more modern BIS economists. I shall then apply this Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit\n\nboom theory to detect and explain unintended consequences of very low world funding\n\ninterest rates in emerging markets.\n\nThe Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom theory is based on Wicksell\u2019s ideas of the \u2018cumulative\n\nprocess\u2019 that gives the interest rate mechanism a central role in coordinating planned savings\n\nand investment. The theory distinguishes between a natural rate of interest and a market rate\n\nof interest.\n\n1 There is, of course, some empirical literature that provides evidence that the original theory has some\nexplanatory power (see e.g. Keeler, 2001; Mulligan, 2006).\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n1368 A. HOFFMANN\n\n\n\nAt the natural interest rate in, planned saving and investment demand are balanced as illus-\n\ntrated in Figure 1 (I1 = S1). Thus, the natural rate of interest is the interest rate that emerges\n\nin goods market equilibrium. It more or less represents the interest rate considered in real\n\nmacroeconomic models (Borio and Disyatat, 2011). If households decide to forgo current con-\n\nsumption, the preference change shifts the planned saving curve to the right. The natural rate\n\nof interest falls. At the lower natural rate of interest, investment demand is higher. A rise in\n\ninvestment will allow households to obtain additional consumption goods in the future.\n\nPlanned saving and investment are inter-temporally coordinated.\n\nIn the real world, however, we cannot observe the natural rate of interest but only the mar-\n\nket rate of interest ic. This market rate of interest is the financing interest rate in the economy.\n\nThis financing interest rate is not only influenced by people\u2019s consumption preferences but\n\nalso by monetary and financial factors. According to Mises (1928) and Hayek (1976 [1929]),\n\nthe central bank has a great impact on the market interest rate. Borio and Disyatat (2011)\n\nexplain that the risk-free short-run market interest rate is controlled by the central bank, while\n\nthe long-run market rate reflects expectations concerning future monetary policy. However,\n\nfinancial market conditions also matter. For instance, risk perception (credit, liquidity or mar-\n\nket risk) adds a premium to the risk-free market interest rate.2 For simplicity, however, in the\n\nfollowing, I shall abstract from possible changes in risk perception. I assume that only the\n\ncentral bank influences the market rate of interest.\n\nIf the central bank holds the market rate of interest equal to the natural rate of interest\n\n(in1 \ufffd ic1 = 0), the economy\u2019s financing conditions reflect the plans of savers and investors.\n\nFinancing conditions are neutral with respect to consumption and investment plans. If, by con-\n\ntrast, the central bank pushes the market rate of interest ic below the natural interest rate in,\n\ni\n\nI, S\n\nI1,2\n\nin1,2\n, ic1\n\nic2\n\nI2\n\nI1 = S1 \n\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS2\nC\n\n\u0394 C1\n\nFIGURE 1\nIllustration of the Credit Boom\n\n2 Hayek (1976 [1929]) offers several reasons for changes in the market rate of interest. He stresses the\ncrucial role of the elasticity of the credit system and the effects of fierce bank competition for larger\nmarket shares in bringing on credit cycles. A too-expansionary monetary policy is seen as a possible\ntrigger but not a necessary condition for pushing the market rate below the natural rate of interest.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\nZERO-INTEREST RATE POLICY AND EMERGING MARKETS 1369\n\n\n\nfor example, to stimulate the economy temporarily, the financing conditions are not in line\n\nwith goods market equilibrium. This is the central cause of the credit boom in the Mises\u2013\nHayek-BIS view.\n\nA fall in the market interest rate triggers additional investment demand. While household\n\nsaving decisions may be less interest rate-elastic than investment demand, at lower market\n\ninterest rates, planned saving tends to fall, not rise. Therefore, projects are financed that are\n\nnot backed by respective planned saving. The difference has to be financed by credit. Figure 1\n\nshows that, at in2 \ufffd ic2 [ 0, planned investment exceeds planned saving by I2 \ufffd S2 > 0. The\n\ncredit expansion is illustrated by a right shift of the saving curve to SC2 , which then represents\n\nplanned savings S1 plus the additional credit supply \u0394C1 at the fallen market interest rate.\n\nIn Wicksell\u2019s theory, the credit expansion results in a cumulative process during which\n\nforced saving, in the form of increases in consumer price inflation, re-establishes the saving-\n\ninvestment equilibrium. The Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS view, however, suggests that a general rise in\n\nthe price level is not a necessary consequence. Instead, the divergence of the market interest\n\nrate from the natural interest rate manifests itself in a distortion of relative prices and the\n\nbuilding of an unsustainable credit boom. In particular, in the Austrian theory of Mises and\n\nHayek, a fall in market interest rates does not affect all investment projects in the same man-\n\nner but distorts the economy\u2019s production structure (Mises, 1912; Hayek, 1967; Hayek, 1976\n\n[1929]) as the value of capital goods rises relative to that of consumer goods.3\n\nIn this regard, for example, O\u2019Driscoll and Rizzo (1996) suggest that the present value for-\n\nmula for capital goods can help make sense of the change in the production structure follow-\n\ning a drop in market interest rates. Under the assumption that expected returns on future\n\noutput rise with the fall in market interest rates implying an increase in future demand for\n\nconsumer goods (in goods market equilibrium, this would be the case), the present value of\n\ndurable capital goods with multi-period income streams rises relative to that of consumer\n\ngoods. The capitalisation formula can be summarised as follows:\n\nPV \u00bc C1\n\n\u00f01\u00fe ic\u00de \u00fe\nC2\n\n\u00f01\u00fe ic\u00de2\n\u00fe . . .\u00fe Ct\n\n\u00f01\u00fe ic\u00det\n;\n\nwith PV being the present value of a capital good with income streams over t periods. C1 . . .\nCt are the expected income streams that are discounted using the interest rate ic.\n\n4 It is easy to\n\nsee that the present value of durable capital goods rises relative to the present value of less\n\ndurable capital goods with a fall in interest rates.\n\nThe rise in net present value can fuel the asset prices of the respective firms and bring\n\nabout an overinvestment boom in capital goods. Unemployed capacities and labour are drawn\n\ninto the production of capital goods. Rising employment, wages and income stimulate con-\n\nsumption. Given low interest rates, the demand for consumer goods \u2013 particularly durable\n\ngoods \u2013 rises as well (consumer credit is cheaper, too). Rising demand provides an incentive\n\nto increase capacities further (Garrison, 2004). This stimulates expectations of high returns in\n\ncapital goods industries (Hayek, 1937a). Households that aim at participating in rising\n\n3 For a more complete depiction of the Austrian theory, see Garrison (2006), Salerno (2012) and Young\n(2013).\n4 See Machlup (1935) for the impact of a change in interest rates on the capitalisation factors of capital\ngoods. Further, Garrison (2004, 2006) presents a graphical model including the Hayekian triangle to\nillustrate the distortionary effects of monetary expansion. Young (2013) adds triangles to incorporate\nchanges in consumption and risk in the Mises\u2013Hayek\u2013Garrison framework.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n1370 A. HOFFMANN\n\n\n\nenterprise profits in an environment of low interest rates may, more than before, channel\n\nplanned savings into asset markets.\n\nWhen households provide additional capital for investment, the saving curve endogenously\n\nshifts to the right and the inflationary pressure in the consumer goods sectors is dampened.\n\nWith an increase in firm equity, banks are inclined to lend even more at the low market inter-\n\nest rate. The profitability and sustainability of investment becomes more and more dependent\n\non low market interest rates and the high level of asset prices. The longer the process lasts,\n\nthe more vulnerable the economy is to a shock in financing conditions, and the bigger is the\n\ncoming \u2018catastrophe\u2019 (Mises, 1912).\n\nThe boom turns bust when consumer prices finally move upward. Then the net present\n\nvalue of durable capital goods declines relative to consumer goods. As relative prices adjust,\n\noverinvested industries see a correction, the economy goes into crisis and unemployment\n\nsoars. Further, if the central bank raises market interest rates to stem inflation, the worsening\n\nof financing conditions lifts the threshold for the profitability of investment projects. The more\n\nmodern BIS view implies that there are many possible triggers of a bust, such as an increase\n\nin the risk perception of market participants. The depth of the crisis following the bursting of\n\nthe credit boom may be explained by a Keynesian story of falling demand and balance-sheet\n\nrecessions (O\u2019Driscoll and Rizzo, 1996; Hoffmann and Schnabl, 2011).\n\nThe policy implication is not an easy one. As the distortion of relative prices and an\n\nunsustainable credit boom are unintended consequences of holding market interest rates too\n\nlow, a general monetary policy rule should be to hold market interest rates close to an\n\nunknown \u2018natural rate of interest\u2019. This, of course, poses some problems. Borio and Disyatat\n\n(2011) suggest monitoring phenomena that usually go along with a divergence of the market\n\nand the natural interest rate. Central bankers should closely watch the liquidity conditions of\n\nthe banking sector, credit growth and the development of asset prices to safeguard the econ-\n\nomy against volatility and severe crisis. Note that the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS perspective on credit\n\nbooms implies that an expansionary monetary policy may cause problems even if inflation is\n\nat the targeted levels.\n\nb. Downward Trend in Global Funding Interest Rates: A Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS View\n\nThe Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit view seems not to have found its way into monetary policy\n\ndecisions of the major economies of the recent past. During the 1990s and 2000s, central\n\nbanks \u2013 above all the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the European\n\nCentral Bank (ECB) \u2013 have cut interest rates decisively when a major asset bubble collapsed\n\nand a downturn in the business cycle was expected. However, they have not raised interest\n\nrates to the same extent in asset boom periods, as inflation rates remained at moderate levels.\n\nThis behaviour reflects the so-called Jackson Hole Consensus view on dealing with asset\n\nbooms according to which severe asset market busts have to be addressed by appropriate\n\ninterest rate cuts to prevent spillovers into the real economy (Blinder and Reis, 2005). By\n\ncontrast, accelerating credit growth and rising asset prices per se are not seen as matters of\n\nparticular concern. Asset prices are mainly considered a transmission channel of monetary\n\npolicy to stabilise inflation and output (Bernanke and Gertler, 2001).\n\nThe implied asymmetric intervention pattern with respect to asset markets can be observed\n\nin Japan in the aftermath of the Japanese crisis. Over the course of the 1990s, real interest\n\nrates fell and allowed the financing of investment projects with lower returns (Figure 2). Even\n\nwhen the Japanese economy stabilised in the years prior to the East Asian crisis, the BoJ did\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\nZERO-INTEREST RATE POLICY AND EMERGING MARKETS 1371\n\n\n\nReal Rates \n\nNominal Rates \n10\n\nGermany US Japan\n\nGermany US Japan\n\nPe\nr \n\nC\nen\n\nt\nPe\n\nr \nC\n\nen\nt\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20132\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n\u20134\n\nJan-90 Jan-93 Jan-96 Jan-99 Jan-02 Jan-05 Jan-08 Jan-11\n\nJan-90 Jan-93 Jan-96 Jan-99 Jan-02 Jan-05 Jan-08 Jan-11\n\nFIGURE 2\nNominal and Real Interest Rates in the US, Germany and Japan\n\nSource: IMF, IFS, 2012, Money Market Rates.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n1372 A. HOFFMANN\n\n\n\nnot lift policy interest rates to stimulate the recovery further. It is well known that easy credit\n\nconditions then fuelled financial flows and credit and asset market bubbles in the tiger econo-\n\nmies. When the over-expanded Japanese banking and export sectors were hit during the East\n\nAsian crisis of 1997\u201398, by contrast, the BoJ pushed market interest rates further down and\n\nbailed out banks and enterprises.\n\nIn the US, the asymmetric pattern is particularly obvious following the bursting of the US\n\ndot-com bubble. The Fed cut interest rates decisively to a (then) unprecedented low of one per\n\ncent (Figure 2). However, when economic growth picked up in 2003, the Fed hesitated in raising\n\npolicy interest rates to promote employment and preserve growth. Too-low interest rates gave\n\nmomentum to the building of the US subprime market bubble (Taylor, 2009; Salerno, 2012). On\n\nthe other side of the Atlantic, the ECB seems to have followed the Fed\u2019s policy in the aftermath\n\nof the dot-com crash. Thus, low interest rates fuelled credit and asset market booms in the inner\n\nand outer periphery of the euro area. Capital flows to Central, Eastern, Southern and Western\n\nEurope stimulated credit booms until 2007\u20132008 (Hoffmann, 2010).\n\nOverall, the asymmetric intervention scheme contributed to a decline in nominal and real\n\ninterest rates in the large advanced countries (corresponding to bursting asset bubbles). From a\n\nMises\u2013Hayek-BIS perspective, the decline in interest rates is sustainable only if the natural rate\n\nof interest declined over the same period. However, the growth potential of the advanced econo-\n\nmies, which may be seen as a proxy for the long-term natural interest rate, has not declined to\n\nthe same extent (Laubach and Williams, 2003). Further, recurring sectoral investment bubbles in\n\nstock and real estate markets suggest that the downward trend in market interest rates has not\n\nreflected that in natural interest rates from the credit boom perspective. Instead, market interest\n\nrates seem to have been held below natural interest rates over and over again.\n\nIn the US, the downward trend in market interest rates came to an end with the Lehman\n\ncollapse in 2008 when the US Federal Reserve (Fed) began to slash policy interest rates\n\ntowards zero to prevent the deleveraging of the financial sector and stabilise output and price\n\nlevels. With interest rates approaching the zero bound, the Fed started to make use of uncon-\n\nventional monetary policy measures or quantitative easing to prevent a collapse in the money\n\nsupply and a major balance-sheet recession as seen during the Great Depression (Bernanke,\n\n2010). As a consequence, the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheets exploded. Monetary stimulus\n\nwas flanked by substantial expansionary fiscal policy to stabilise markets and employment.\n\nThe ECB dealt with the crisis in a similar fashion and cut policy interest rates, albeit not\n\nas rapidly, to an all-time low. Because the financial crisis of 2008 was followed by a sover-\n\neign debt crisis in some Eastern and Southern European countries, interest rate cuts were fol-\n\nlowed by IMF credit facilities, public capital injections to euro-area commercial banks with\n\nlarge credit exposure in the region and ECB government bonds purchases of crisis countries\n\nas well as the European crisis management facilities that injected credit to keep government\n\nbond yields below-market yields. Not surprisingly, ECB balance sheets lengthened as well.\n\nCurrently, the European Union is discussing further measures to deal with the fiscal disaster\n\nand potential spillover effects on the banking system.\n\nAgain, from the perspective of the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom theory, pushing real\n\ninterest rates to zero or below presupposes that the natural rate of interest is zero such that\n\nthe saving-investment balance is re-established and the economy prepared to take-off. A dra-\n\nmatic monetary accommodation is reasonable as long as a bank panic has dramatically raised\n\nbanks\u2019 lending and borrowing rates in the inter-banking market (Hayek, 1967 [1935]) and the\n\ncentral bank aims at aligning financing interest rates to the natural rate. However, although\n\ninter-banking rates converged back towards the policy interest rate in 2009, the monetary\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\nZERO-INTEREST RATE POLICY AND EMERGING MARKETS 1373\n\n\n\naccommodation was not reversed as investment and growth in the crisis economies did not\n\npick up and unemployment continued to soar.\n\nIn line with historical accounts of the development of economies in the aftermath of a\n\nsevere financial crisis, growth in the crisis economies has not picked up much (Reinhart and\n\nReinhart, 2010). Given the slow recovery (and even though growth and inflation rates are\n\npositive), Summers (2013) suggests that the natural interest rate has fallen to zero or even\n\nbelow zero. He therefore, calls for some unconventional macroeconomic thinking and an\n\nexpansion of the crisis policies. A prolonged period of very low nominal and real interest\n\nrates seems unavoidable.\n\nc. Depressed Natural Interest Rate as Unintended Consequence of Crisis Policies?\n\nFrom the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS perspective, too, the slow recovery of the economies may be\n\nviewed as evidence that the natural interest rate has fallen. But the Austrians would not see\n\ncrisis policies as the cure but rather as the reason for a sluggish readjustment of the economy.\n\nAccording to Mises\u2019 law of unintended consequences, well-intended price interventions,\n\nsuch as a reduction in market interest rates, that prevent a rapid readjustment of distorted rela-\n\ntive prices during crisis periods, may help fix some problems (at least temporarily). However,\n\nsuch interventions often have even worse unintended consequences in some other parts of the\n\nmarket as price distortions feed themselves through the price system (Mises, 1929). From this\n\nperspective, the zero-interest rate policy that aims at stabilising the economy may in fact\n\nworsen the problems and make necessary a series of further interventions (as proposed by\n\nSummers, 2013) to deal with the unintended adjustment costs.5\n\nMcKinnon (2009) describes a very direct negative side effect for small local banks in the US\n\nthat can be attributed to holding market interest rates at the zero bound. Even though small local\n\nbanks may have access to customers, they may be priced out of the market for funds by the cen-\n\ntral bank. McKinnon (2009) reasons that it is not possible to get funding from larger banks at\n\nclose to zero costs, as any borrowing risk is larger than the market interest rate and borrowing to\n\nother banks is always more speculative than holding excess reserves at the Fed.\n\nFurther, from a particular Austrian point of view, the recent history of financial excesses\n\nmay increase uncertainty about investment prospects if no visible market cleansing and\n\nrestructuring of the economy are allowed for. Well-intended monetary accommodation to pre-\n\nvent deleveraging may prevent the rebounce of the economy if investment expectations\n\nbecome less elastic with respect to the change in market interest rates, as market participants\n\n\u2018will avoid using for an expansion of their operations the easy money available, because they\n\nwill keep in mind the inevitable end of the boom\u2019 (Mises, 1943, p. 251).6\n\nIf this Austrian depiction is valid, the US and European economies are at a point at which\n\nholding market interest rates low does not by itself restore confidence to bring about a take-\n\n5 See White (2012) for an extensive account on unintended side effects of zero-interest rate policy in\nthe US economy.\n6 In line with Mises (1943), Salerno (2012, pp. 22\u20133) reasons that \u2018the recession will be further pro-\nlonged by the fact that entrepreneurs, after experiencing massive losses and capital write-downs, will\ntemporarily lose confidence both in their ability to forecast future market conditions and in the reliability\nof monetary calculation\u2019. Argues Salerno (2012, p. 23), \u2018It is precisely the rise of the natural interest rate\nimplicit in the relative decline of factor prices that restores the entrepreneurs\u2019 natural optimism and ven-\nturesomeness\u2019.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n1374 A. HOFFMANN\n\n\n\noff of investment \u2013 at least in the short run. When factor prices in the mal-invested sectors\n\nare not allowed to fall during the recession, a rational fear of future adjustments prevails. This\n\nmay result in a lower growth potential of the crisis economies for some time and a very low\n\nnatural interest rate with little planned investment. In the medium and long run, it is plausible\n\nthat the profitability in other sectors and new real or financial innovations raise investment\n\ndemand and thereby the natural rate of interest in the economy (Hayek, 1937a).\n\nHowever, when fear of an adjustment in the crisis sectors prevents central banks from lift-\n\ning the policy interest rate again, another credit boom period can be fuelled, when as Schum-\n\npeter (1989, p.117) put it, \u2018artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone\n\nand adds, to an undigested remnant of maladjustment, new maladjustment of its own which\n\nhas to be liquidated in turn, thus threatening business with another crisis ahead\u2019.\n\nIn Japan, policy interest rates have been close to zero since 1999. The profitability of all sec-\n\ntors fell. Today, a rise in market interest rates puts entire industries at risk. In the US, the finan-\n\ncial sector rebounded following the stimuli in 2011. Given that the US financial markets are the\n\ndeepest and most innovative in the world, they are a safe haven for international capital and help\n\nthe recovery process. In Europe, the recovery of the crisis economies is still out of sight. In both\n\nEurope and the US, sluggish investment demand hinges on low interest rates. Increases in market\n\ninterest rates are widely considered to cause major damage. This suggests \u2013 from a Mises\u2013Hay-\nek-BIS perspective \u2013 that the natural rate of interest has declined and that there seems to be little\n\ndanger of fuelling another credit boom in the advanced economies in the short run. However, it\n\nmay also be interpreted as a sign that the adjustment of the economy is incomplete. Then the\n\ndevelopment of asset markets may, of course, be a concern.\n\n3. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROLONGED LOW INTEREST RATE\n\nENVIRONMENT IN EMERGING MARKETS\n\na. Global Natural Rate Gap and Financial Flows to Emerging Markets\n\nWhereas policy interest rates in the world\u2019s major funding economies are close to zero, which\n\nmay reflect the depressed natural rate of interest, the world GDP has grown several per cent per\n\nannum since 2009. In particular, the economies of East Asia and Latin America were barely hit\n\nby the crisis (Reinhart, 2013). The fast recovery of investment in emerging regions in compari-\n\nson with the investment recovery in advanced economies is captured in Figure 3. The clear gap\n\nin investment as a percentage of GDP between the advanced economies and emerging markets\n\nsince the 2000s is indicative of a decoupling of emerging market business cycles from those in\n\nthe advanced economies (Kose et al., 2012). This trend seems to have been reinforced by the\n\nrecent crisis, as evidenced by the further rising investment gap since 2009.\n\nWhile the low funding interest rates in the world\u2019s major financial markets may reflect the\n\ndepressed investment demand in the advanced economies, the low interest rate level does not\n\nleave the emerging markets unaffected (Portes, 2012). Taking the natural interest rate concept\n\nto a global level, real-world funding rates should be aligned with the world natural rate of\n\ninterest. The world\u2019s trend in GDP growth may be a proxy for the trend of the natural rate of\n\ninterest (Laubach and Williams, 2003).7\n\n7 According to neoclassical growth theory, the equilibrium interest rate is equal to the long-term growth\nof capital accumulation.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\nZERO-INTEREST RATE POLICY AND EMERGING MARKETS 1375\n\n\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the Hodrick\u2013Prescott (HP) filtered trend of the world growth rate and\n\nthe HP trend of the weighted average of the real money market rates in the G7 from 1990 to\n\n2011. Based on this approximation, the gap between the world financing and natural interest\n\nrate has been persistent in the 2000s. According to the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS view, the divergence\n\nbetween funding and natural interest rates on a global level should be associated with rising\n\nelasticity in the credit system that reveals itself in amplifying financial flows and swelling\n\ncredit and asset market bubbles that have the potential to turn bust rapidly when financing\n\nconditions worsen (Borio and Disyatat, 2011).\n\nWhen it comes to financial flows, the recent literature suggests that debt-led capital flow\n\nepisodes in particular are drivers of rapid credit growth (Lane and McQuade, 2013) and fore-\n\nrunners of episodes of severe capital flow volatility and financial crises (Forbes and Warnock,\n\n2012). In Figure 5, I illustrate the development of the stock of outstanding cross-border loans\n\nin developed and developing economies. In advanced economies, gross liabilities have tripled,\n\nand in developing countries, they have quadrupled when considering the full period from\n\n2001 to 2012. The general increases seem to go along with periods of low funding interest\n\nrates and risk perception in advanced economies. Since the recent financial crisis, however,\n\nthe amount of outstanding claims to advanced economies has dropped with the fall in invest-\n\nment demand. Developing regions, by contrast, saw a further increase in cross-border loans,\n\nas would be expected by the credit boom perspective.\n\nFigure 6 depicts the development of cross-border bank flows to three important groups of\n\nemerging markets, namely emerging Europe, Latin America and East Asia. For all three\n\ngroups, cross-border lending picked up in the 2000s.

Further, the predominance of troubled\n\neuro-area banks may impede the recovery of many Central and Eastern European economies.\n\nIn contrast, cross-border loans to the emerging markets of Latin America and East Asia\n\nincreased from 2000 to 2012, only to be interrupted briefly by the global financial crisis.8\n\nWhile planned investment continues to lag in the advanced economies and therefore the\n\nmarket interest rate remains at low levels, the fastest-growing emerging market economies, in\n\nparticular, saw a substantial rise in volatile equity and debt flows that was hardly intended by\n\nlow funding interest rates in the major advanced economies. Figure 7 shows that, for example,\n\nTurkey and Poland experienced large capital inflows from 2004 to 2006, in 2008 and since\n\n2010. Further short-term capital flows to Brazil and Indonesia have accelerated since 2010 in\n\nan environment of low world funding interest rates (Figure 7).\n\nb.

While foreign (dollar or euro) liquidity is absorbed in their cen-\n\ntral bank balance sheets, monetary expansion pushes down domestic interest rates towards the\n\nlevel of world funding interest rates. Since 2009, the world\u2019s foreign reserve accumulation\n\nhas accelerated. The largest share of additional reserves was accumulated by emerging market\n\neconomies in East Asia (Figure 8).\n\nIn a prolonged period of very low world interest rates, emerging market central banks in\n\ncountries with rather flexible exchange rates also face limits in sovereignty. Now, it is well\n\nknown that currency appreciation or exchange rate volatility may depress international trade\n\n(Goldberg and Tille 2009). However, the excessive debt inflows may put a greater burden on\n\npolicymakers and substantially increase the \u2018fear of floating\u2019 (Calvo and Reinhart, 2002;\n\nReinhart, 2013).\n\nMcKinnon (2010) argues that flexible exchange rates in an environment of benign global\n\nliquidity conditions foster one-way bets on appreciation and asset market bubbles in emerging\n\nmarkets. In the 1930s, Hayek (1937b, p. 63\u201364) observed that \u2018every suspicion that exchange\n\nrates were likely to change in the near future would create an additional powerful motive for\n\nshifting funds\u2019. The rise in financial flows suggests that bank borrowing in international\n\nwholesale markets picked up along with lending in domestic currency. The appreciation of\n\nthe domestic currency will lower the value of foreign liabilities and can contribute to over-\n\nborrowing (McKinnon and Pill, 1997; McKinnon and Schnabl, 2004).

Therefore, policymakers of countries with large foreign currency exposure may\n\nincreasingly depend on exchange rate stability.\n\nFurther excessive financial inflows undermine the independence of central banks in coun-\n\ntries with floating exchange rates as they increase future capital flow volatility and thereby\n\nvulnerability to rapid exchange rate depreciation and crisis. Whereas domestic credit growth\n\nand inflation would suggest that emerging market policymakers should increase the market\n\ninterest rate, financial stability concerns make even inflation-targeting central banks depart\n\nfrom their strategy (Reinhart, 2013). To act as a lender of last resort in a country where\n\nmost borrowing includes foreign loans, central banks have accumulated a significant amount\n\nof dollar reserves to preserve the financial stability of the economy in case of a sudden\n\nreversal.\n\nBecause, in a world of very low interest rates in the major funding economies, emerging\n\nmarket policymakers can hardly prevent a fall in the market interest rate below the natural\n\ninterest rate, in line with the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS view, planned investment exceeds planned\n\nsaving (as in Figure 1) and credit to the private sector grows at a rapid pace (Figure 9). Much\n\nof the additional investment is made in capital-intensive industries, in stock markets and in\n\ndurable assets such as in real estate, as indicated by the rebounding share prices following\n\n2009, shown in Figure 10.\n\nFurther, investors target, for example, precious metals, and in raw material exporting coun-\n\ntries that benefit from the rise in, for example, oil revenues, rising fiscal expenditures or thriv-\n\ning stabilisation funds guide structural change and cause sectoral booms.

In countries with pegged currencies, foreign investment and credit\n\nexpansion translate into higher wages. Given some flexibility in exchange rates, interest rate\n\ncuts to tame appreciation expectations stimulate the economy. The drop in interest rates is an\n\nincentive to increase investment and consumption and borrow against future income. As\n\nimports accelerate and the current accounts turn negative, emerging markets face the risk of\n\nover-borrowing. Consequently, in many fast-growing emerging market economies, inflation\n\ncontinues to soar at pre-crisis rates despite the slowdown in world growth (Figure 11). While\n\nthe economic engines in the advanced economies stutter, credit booms are fuelled that are\n\nlikely to go bust as soon as market interest rates in the world\u2019s major economies rise (Rein-\n\nhart, 2013; Sanchez, 2013).\n\nThe increases in vulnerability caused by the rise in bank lending and asset prices in emerg-\n\ning markets revealed, for example, when Ben Bernanke (chairman of the Federal Reserve\n\nSystem) announced that he would stop purchasing bonds in May 2013. Immediately, US bond\n\nprices rallied up one per cent, and worldwide asset markets showed signs of turbulence.\n\n4. SECOND-ROUND INTERVENTIONISM\n\na. Advanced Economies\n\nSteil (2007) warns that \u2018monetary nationalists\u2019 who aim at stimulating domestic growth\n\neven at the expense of instability abroad will not stop when capital outflows render the policy\n\nineffective. Instead, they further increase accommodation and support capital controls. Build-\n\ning upon Hayek (1937b), Steil (2007) argues that policymakers will tend to control or encour-\n\nage to prevent the outflow of capital and, on the contrary, the inflow of capital into emerging\n\nmarkets because it may make the monetary expansion more effective.\n\n16\n\nPe\nr \n\nC\nen\n\nt\n\nBRICS Poland Turkey\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\nJan-05 Jan-07 Jan-09 Jan-11\n\nFIGURE 11\nInflation in the BRICS, Poland and Turkey\n\nSource: IMF, IFS, 2012.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n1382 A. HOFFMANN\n\n\n\nThe return of financial repression in advanced economies shows, for example, (i) in the\n\nFed\u2019s consideration of using non-market-based instruments to absorb liquidity once inflation\n\nexpectations increase, (ii) in crisis-hit countries such as Spain that have introduced de facto\ninterest rate ceilings on deposits, (iii) in Basel III, which encourages banks to hold govern-\n\nment debt and (iv) in debt that is placed at below-market interest rates in pension funds and\n\nother more captive domestic financial institutions (Reinhart, 2012).\n\nReinhart and Sbrancia (2011) suggest that, given the historical record, it is likely that\n\nfinancial repression will also be used to liquidate high government debt. Low nominal interest\n\nrates may reduce government bond yields and thereby debt-servicing costs. Positive inflation\n\nrates \u2013 for example the suggested four per cent by Blanchard et al. (2010) \u2013 turn real interest\n\nrates negative and liquidate debt. Because financial repression stretches the adjustment in gov-\n\nernment debt levels over a longer period, it may face less opposition when implemented grad-\n\nually than a reform package. This is in the interest of policymakers that aim at re-election\n\nand preventing stirring things up with major spending cuts, as recently seen in Greece and\n\nSpain.\n\nb. Emerging Markets\n\nIn line with Mises\u2019s (1929) law of unintended consequences, the inflationary consequences\n\nin emerging markets are followed by a new round of interventionism and industrial policy in\n\nemerging markets. Emerging market central banks have used various ways to stem capital\n\nflows and asset and consumer price pressure, as evidenced in Table 1.\n\nMarket-based sterilisation such as bond sales causes rising market interest rates and stem\n\ninflation. The increasing spread between funding and investment currencies could, however,\n\nreinforce financial inflows. Hence, to prevent inflationary pressure and capital inflows, non-\n\nmarket-based sterilisation measures such legal reserve requirements with low remuneration9\n\nand capital controls have been lifted since 2009 (Jara et al., 2009; Reinhart, 2012; Sanchez,\n\n2013).\n\nTABLE 1\nStricter Controls on Capital Inflows in Emerging Markets (2008\u20132011)\n\nBrazil 2008, 2009, 2010\nCzech Republic 2008\nHungary 2011\nIndonesia 2010\nKorea 2009, 2010\nPeru 2009, 2010\nPhilippines 2010\nPoland 2011\nRussia 2010, 2011\nSouth Africa 2010\nThailand 2010\nTurkey 2010\n\nSource: Reinhart et al. (2012).\n\n9 Reserve requirements of this sort can have similar effects as capital controls (Reinhart and Reinhart,\n1999).\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\nZERO-INTEREST RATE POLICY AND EMERGING MARKETS 1383\n\n\n\nFurther, particularly in countries with large raw material sectors, emerging market central\n\nbanks tend to coordinate policies with the government. While central banks absorb foreign\n\nliquidity in exchange for domestic liquidity, fiscal authorities agree to sell more government\n\nsecurities than necessary and hold additional revenues in central banks to provide a buffer\n\nagainst revaluation losses of reserves in case of capital flow reversals (L\u20acoffler et al., 2010).\nFor instance, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has often complained about the global\n\nliquidity glut. She blamed the US for bringing on a \u2018global currency war\u2019 by keeping interest\n\nrates near zero. Accelerating portfolio investments in Brazilian asset markets caused fear of\n\noverheating, leading Brazil to strengthen capital controls. While Brazil\u2019s capital controls (e.g.\n\nin foreign exchange markets) kill off some speculative distortionary investment and may help\n\ncontain inflationary pressure, they create further distortions, as they prevent the free allocation\n\nof capital and cause distortions in the real sectors of the economy, for example, by widening\n\nbid-ask spreads in foreign exchange hedging for Brazilian companies.\n\nCountries with fixed exchange rates, such as China, have used non-market-based sterilisa-\n\ntion in combination with credit rationing to contain inflation. In China, foreign portfolio\n\ninvestment is not allowed for. However, the import of US interest rate policy was followed\n\nby repressive measures because sterilisation policies and credit rationing allowed China to sta-\n\nbilise employment and shield the overinvested export sector. Chinese state banks provide\n\ncredit to state-owned enterprises and the export industry, and the sterilisation policies stabilise\n\nreal exchange rates at depreciated values. In contrast, the small and medium-sized companies\n\nof the private sector are repressed and heavily rely on informal markets (Pettis, 2011).\n\nGiven negative real deposit rates and closed capital accounts, Chinese savers have few\n\noptions. They invest in durable assets, such as housing, thereby fuelling a bubble in the\n\nChinese real estate market (Pettis, 2012). Recently, China signalled a more moderate but\n\nguided appreciation of the yuan to kill off inflationary pressure. As appreciation is expected,\n\nrestrictions on foreign exchange and capital inflows are likely to remain in place despite\n\ncurrent discussions on whether or not to make the renminbi convertible to gain international\n\ninfluence.\n\nFurther, for example, Turkey saw itself forced to pursue some unconventional policy mea-\n\nsures. To prevent a rise in market interest rates and an additional shift of funds into Turkish\n\nmarkets, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey first reduced policy rates to shield capi-\n\ntal inflows and then raised unremunerated reserve requirements to stem credit growth in early\n\n2011. Theoretically, the effect is a quasi-tax on lending rates. As firms in underdeveloped\n\ncapital markets cannot issue bonds (they like to refinance because corporate bond markets are\n\nnot well developed), funding, for example in Turkey, depends largely on banks\u2019 credit for the\n\nprivate sector. Thus, banks can pass the costs of the reserve requirements on to the customers.\n\nShortly after the central bank implemented the measures, financial stocks lost about 20 per\n\ncent. The depreciation of the currency led foreign investors to sell from their portfolios, but\n\nthe markets rebounded.\n\nIn October 2011, the Turkish central bank raised the overnight lending rate to restrict lend-\n\ning again but kept borrowing rates low to allow financial institutions to get funds easily when\n\nin need. While capital inflows are capped, financial sector distortions are evidenced in lend-\n\ning-deposit rate spreads and financial disintermediation. Even though markets seemed rela-\n\ntively stable and the growth performance was at a high level in 2012, the recurring short\n\nturbulences and the year over year inflation rate of 11 per cent (April 2012) signalled that the\n\nrisks taken by investors in emerging markets around the world might be very high and that\n\nthe economies had started to overheat. The Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom perspective\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n\n1384 A. HOFFMANN\n\n\n\nsuggests that a more moderate monetary policy stance in the advanced economies might turn\n\nthe Turkish boom into a bust.\n\n5. SUMMARY\n\nIn response to the Great Recession, central banks in most large advanced economies have\n\ncut interest rates to zero and increased monetary accommodation to stabilise domestic mar-\n\nkets. This paper has outlined unintended consequences of the current low interest rate policies\n\nfor emerging markets. Based on the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom view, I have argued that\n\nthe current monetary policy stance in advanced economies may have planted the seeds of new\n\nbubbles and given rise to interventionist cycles in emerging markets.\n\nIn particular, I have argued \u2013 along the lines of the Mises\u2013Hayek-BIS credit boom theory\n\n\u2013 that the low interest rate environment unintentionally encourages financial flows that feed\n\ncredit and asset market bubbles in fast-growing emerging markets. In fear of destabilising\n\nfinancial inflows, emerging market central banks tend to follow the interest rate policies in\n\nadvanced economies. This triggers malinvestment and overheating pressure in emerging mar-\n\nkets. With the increased dependence of global lending on low interest rates, a return to ortho-\n\ndox policies in the advanced economies brings about severe risks for capital reversals. To\n\nstem rising inflationary pressure and kill off buoyant capital flows, financial markets in emerg-\n\ning markets are increasingly repressed.\n\nFrom the point of view of the credit boom theories, the prolonged period of very low inter-\n\nest rates in economies with major funding currencies may prove incompatible with financial\n\nintegration and globalisation, as global business cycles are not synchronised and emerging\n\nmarkets are likely to take additional measures to stem the risks associated with financial\n\ninflows and reversals (Sanchez, 2013). Therefore, the paper suggests that the growth objec-\n\ntives of central banks in large advanced economies may \u2013 as Steil (2007) put it metaphori-\n\ncally \u2013 become the \u2018Achilles\u2019 heel of globalisation\u2019 if more and more small emerging market\n\ncountries see themselves forced to implement capital flow restrictions to deal with inflationary\n\npressure and financial volatility.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBernanke, B.
