First, three speeches by leading officials speak of Beijing\u2019s close knowledge of and direct involvement in the mass internment drive. They show that the leadership demanded security forces to open fire on persons seeking to escape detention, or on those who dared to resist the state. Second, a set of security directives for re-education camp police outlines how the camps are guarded by special police units armed with military assault rifles and sniper guns. They state that detainees are to be transported wearing handcuffs, shackles, and hoods, and are to be guarded by police.\u00a0\nThe English translations are digitally-signed PDFs.
