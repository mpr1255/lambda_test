(2014). Arming the Sultan. German Arms Trade and Personal\nDiplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I. London/New York: I. B.\nTauris, 349 pp., $110, \u00a361.20.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire has always been a very interesting subject for scholars. Whereas\nthe majority of scholars have concentrated their interests either on its decay or, for\nexample, on the importance of the Bagdad Railway for international relations, very few\nhave so far taken a deeper look into the role of the arms business for in Ottoman as well\nas European history. The lack of access to the sources in the respective archives was, of\ncourse, one of the main reasons to make research more difficult than in other cases.\n\nAgainst this background this study breaks new ground. Based on a wealth of archival\nmaterial the author is able to throw a new and very interesting light on the role of the\narms business in Ottoman policy towards European countries and vice versa. One of the\nmost important questions he tries to answer is why German armament firms dominated\nthe Ottoman market from the 1880s onwards until the outbreak of World War I, even\nthough their products were neither always better nor cheaper than those of other\ncompetitors in Britain or France. It is striking to see how much the Germans could\nsell: guns from Krupp, rifles from Mauser/Oberndorf and warships coming from the\nSchichau yards at Danzig and Elbing. In the event, war materials made up almost two-\nthirds of Germany\u2019s exports into the Ottoman Empire throughout the whole period\nunder investigation here.\n\nHis answer is convincing: in his eyes the Ottoman Empire serves as a very good\nexample of the intertwined relationship of political, military and business factors, as well\nas \u201ca good measure of personal interest\u201d (p. 254). A closer look shows that arms sales\nwere, at least from the German point of view, indeed a very good means to combine\npolitical, economic and military expansionist interests. That is why the German govern-\nment supported German arms firms after unification in 1871. From the politicians\u2019 point\nof view the arms business was an influential tool to get access to the circles of foreign\nmilitary decision-makers and the politicians behind them. Subsequently, even the\nGerman \u201cIron Chancellor,\u201d Otto von Bismarck, supported this business despite his\nclaim that the Balkan states, as he stated in 1876, was \u201cnot worth the bones of a single\nPrussian grenadier.\u201d However, political backing is only one factor which explains this\nsuccess story. Without clever planning and, moreover, the dispatch of a military mission\nconsisting of high-ranking and highly qualified German officers such as Colmar von der\nGoltz-Pascha, this success would hardly have been possible. This strategy was accom-\npanied by the attempt to make the sultan believe that Germany was a friend and a\nsupporter of his policy, which had attracted sharp criticism from other European powers.\nUnlike Britain, France or Russia, Germany made no attempt to take over parts of the\nempire of the \u201csick man on the Bosporus\u201d. Rather, Germany had a great interest in\nstability in this region, at least as long as it was not strong enough to receive the lion\u2019s\nshare in case a partition of the Ottoman Empire was unavoidable. Consequently, for the\ntime being, this meant keeping up good relations with the Ottoman government and,\nmore importantly, with its military. Without this special relationship which both sides\ndeveloped within an incredibly short period of time the arms business would not have\nflourished in the way it eventually did. Astonishingly, this relationship was strong\n\nDIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT\n2016, VOL. 27, NO. 1, 185\u2013186\n\n\n\nenough to overcome problems about higher prices or technical deficiencies if compared\nwith the products offered by British or French arms firms. Even British diplomats\naccustomed to successfully support British political, military, and economic interests in\nthe nineteenth century due to the great weight of the Empire in international relations,\nwere surprised about this development in the 1880s. \u201cNever [had] a great European\npower acquired so rapidly and with so little apparent effort a position of authority and\nprivilege in a decadent Oriental state with which its previous connections and actual\ncommunity of interests seemed so slender,\u201d Sir Valentine Chirol complained in a letter\nto his government.\n\nIn his case study the author affords a deep insight into an important aspect of both\nOttoman and European history. Based on broad archival research he remarkably\ndescribes Germany\u2019s expansionist strategy in the Middle East based on the success of\nGerman arms dealers who, backed by politicians in Berlin, quickly gained a stronghold\nno other power was able to question before 1914. Thus the author makes an important\ncontribution to our understanding of the political, military, and economic developments\nbefore 1914.\n\nMichael Epkenhans\nPotsdam\n\n\u00a9 2016 Taylor & Francis\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592296.2016.1137745\n\n186 BOOK REVIEW\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592296.2016.1137745\n\n\tBook Review\n\n"}
