OOSTEROM*\n\nABSTRACT\nThis article draws on qualitative case study research in Murewa, a rural\ndistrict town in Zimbabwe, to extend the use of the concept of \u2018social\nnavigation\u2019 from conflict-affected settings to repressive regime contexts.\nThrough the concept of \u2018the everyday\u2019, it analyses how youth experience\npolitical violence and repression, and the tactics they use to access paid\nwork and secure self-employment. The findings show that youth accept\nexisting forms of political violence and repression as normal, and that the\nhistorical construction of politicized youth matters for how they under-\nstand their room for manoeuvre within it. Since partisan actors control\nmany of the economic opportunities, social navigation is about the need\nto assess the political affiliation of actors that offer any economic oppor-\ntunity, and the potential implications of being associated with a particular\n\u2018side\u2019 in the political landscape. Contrary to dominant discourses that\nportray youth as violent, this study shows that many will avoid relation-\nships through which they risk being mobilized into violence.\n\nWITH \u2018OPERATION RESTORE LEGACY\u2019, THE ZIMBABWEAN military ended\n37 years of rule by President Robert Mugabe in November 2017 \u2013 an\naction internationally regarded as a \u2018soft coup\u2019.1 Young Zimbabweans\nhave grown up with state repression and cycles of election violence,\n\n*Marjoke A.

Youth constantly calculate the potential implications of being asso-\nciated with a particular \u2018side\u2019 along the fault lines that mark the political\nlandscape, which became more complex due to factionalism. The study\nfinds that many youth are reluctant to access opportunities through parti-\nsan actors, knowing how these actors have mobilized youth to participate\nin electoral violence in the past. Zimbabwean youth have embodied the\nhistorical construction of \u2018politicized youth\u2019, which influences their per-\nception that their room for manoeuvre is narrow, thus prompting many to\ndeploy tactics to avoid risk, and mobilization into violence. The article\nthus contributes to a broader literature on youth politics and conflict in\nAfrica. A dominant narrative is that disenfranchised youth, and especially\nunemployed young males, pose a threat to a country\u2019s stability.12 This\nstudy confirms that many youth respond to adversity in largely non-\nviolent ways,13 and the concepts of \u2018the everyday\u2019 and \u2018social navigation\u2019\nare crucial for understanding how. It extends the concept of social naviga-\ntion by emphasizing the influence of memories of violence from the past, in\naddition to Vigh\u2019s emphasis on the anticipated future.14 Finally, the article\nalso adds to existing literatures on youth and politics in Zimbabwe. While\nfactionalism has been discussed at the level of political elites,15 this article\nshows the repercussions for youth on the ground in ways which have been\nhitherto unexamined.\n\nThe first section shows how young people have been essential to politics\nin Zimbabwe, and how this has contributed to \u2018youth\u2019 being seen as a\npoliticized social category.

The final sec-\ntion demonstrates how youth navigate economic opportunities in this\ndeeply politicized environment.\n\nPoliticized youth in Zimbabwe\n\nIn Zimbabwe, \u2018youth\u2019 are viewed as a category of people that mobilizes, or\ncan be mobilized, for political interests. The association between youth and\npolitical mobilization is a clear indication that \u2018youth\u2019 is not simply defined\nby age, even though the official government definition says a youth is any-\none between the ages of 10 and 30.16 Deborah Durham argues that youth\nis a relational term and part of relationships of power, which draws atten-\ntion to the political and pragmatic processes through which some make\nclaims of being a youth, or try to designate others as youth.17 Durham\u2019s\nconceptualization of youth is helpful for understanding youth in Zimbabwe,\nas different political parties have directly appealed to and mobilized youth,\nand constructed narratives about youth that served political agendas.\nFailed public policies and the multiple political and economic crises have\n\nresulted in a lack of opportunities for African youth.18 Many youth live in a\nprolonged period of \u2018waithood\u2019.19 For Zimbabwe, it is argued that the pro-\nmises of independence remain unfulfilled for the country\u2019s large youth\npopulation because of the state of the economy.20 In many countries, such\nyouth disenfranchisement has led to protests against governments, as youth\nsee corruption and bad governance as major causes for the opportunities\nthey are lacking.21 A now dominant narrative on youth in Africa portrays\nthem as \u2018trouble makers\u2019 and has focused on the risks of large \u2018youth\n\n16.

The Shona word vakomana (boys) became the synonym\nfor those fighting in the guerrilla forces (despite many of the fighters being\nfemale) and many others acted as guerrilla collaborators.26 Norma Kriger\nshowed that many youth were persuaded to join the struggle out of frustration\nwith social structures that they considered oppressive, and not for purely ideo-\nlogical reasons.27 Immediately after independence, many youth were support-\nive of the new government, but from 1987 onwards students started to protest\nagainst the government over student welfare and government corruption scan-\ndals.28 Protests continued in the early 1990s related to increased government\ncontrol over universities, as well as student housing and welfare. Students\njoined civic organizations and trade unions to oppose the Economic Structural\nAdjustment Programme that was adopted in 1991.29\n\nStudents and youth groups also took part in the National Constitutional\nAssembly (NCA) in 1999; a coalition of civic organizations and the\nZimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) formed in 1999 to debate\nconstitutional reforms. It was out of this coalition that the Movement for\nDemocratic Change (MDC) emerged under the leadership of Morgan\nTsvangirai. In 2000, the government lost the referendum on the draft\nConstitution due to the mobilization by the NCA, and in subsequent elec-\ntions the MDC gained a significant share of the votes.30 ZANU-PF started\n\n22.

Government officials and ZANU-PF labelled youth\nas \u201cborn-frees\u201d \u2013 born after independence \u2013 a term mostly derogatively\nused to express that younger generations could not \u2018appreciate the privilege\nof being \u201cborn-free\u2019\u2019\u2217.31 Student protests were portrayed as a betrayal of\nboth the ruling party and the liberation war.32\n\nAware that grievances over lack of educational and job opportunities\namong youth had generated support for the MDC, the government estab-\nlished the Ministry of Youth and Development and Employment\nCreation in 2000.

The MDC had already split into two factions in 2005,\nwhen disaffected MDC members formed MDC-Ncube, leaving behind\nMDC-Tsvangirai (MDC-T). In 2014 a group broke away from MDC-T\nto form MDC-Renewal, and in September 2015 MDC-N and MDC-\nRenewal joined forces in the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), led by\nTendai Biti. Meanwhile, a group of younger generation politicians within\nZANU-PF emerged as the G40 group, aligned to Grace Mugabe.50 Soon\nafter the soft coup in November 2017, Emmerson Mnangagwa took over\nthe presidency and leadership of ZANU-PF, and party leadership purged\ntop officials linked to G40.51 ZANU-PF won the national elections in July\n2018 and Mnangagwa won the Presidential elections with 50.8 percent of\nthe votes.

It is often assumed that such vio-\nlent conflict results in chaos \u2013 a vacuum of authority and a disintegration\nof social institutions and other forms of social life.55 However, rather than\nseeing a crisis as a major event or episode, others have argued that if a crisis\nbecomes chronic, it becomes the anticipated reality for most people.56\n\nPeople will \u2018normalize\u2019 certain forms of violence as something that is part\nof their environment, and the background against which everyday life con-\ntinues to be produced.57 In the midst of uncertainty, people are constantly\ntrying to maximize opportunities.58 The concept of \u2018the everyday\u2019 refers\nto social and cultural acts and processes that people consider normal part\nof life, and draws attention to the ways in which people seek to influence,\nreorganize and appropriate the structures that affect their lives.59\n\nAlthough social institutions are constantly being disintegrated during pro-\nlonged periods of crisis, a focus on the everyday shows how these institu-\ntions are also being rebuilt, as are different configurations of power, which\nmay offer new opportunities for addressing everyday concerns.60\n\nPeople living in highly unstable environments need to continuously\nassess the ongoing changes and shifts in their context, and this underpins\ntheir everyday social practice.61 To depict this behaviour, Vigh introduced\nthe concept of \u2018social navigation\u2019, which he defines as the process whereby\n\n54.

This \u2018piecing together\u201967\n\nof relationships helps circulate goods and maximize gains, while for youth it\nis also about progressing socially and constructing youth identities.68\n\nOthers have highlighted how youth build relationships with powerful\nfigures to enhance their prospects or escape a life they did not want; mil-\nitia leaders or prominent \u2018big men\u2019.69 When entering patrimonial relation-\nships with \u2018big men\u2019 some youth feel they need to engage in acts of\nviolence to signal their loyalty to the patron.70 In South African town-\nships, youth continuously reposition and align themselves with politicians\nand local power brokers, and therefore Hannah Dawson speaks of\n\n62.

However, Jones\u2019 analysis does not address how partisan\nagents control economic opportunities,76 while it has been acknowledged\nthat ZANU-PF agents threaten opposition supporters with their exclusion\nfrom economic resources.77 ZANU-PF agents are also involved in regu-\nlating informal trade and vending.78 It is thus likely that youth need to\nassess and navigate the risks associated with, for instance, accessing work\nopportunities through party agents.\n\nCase study and research methodology\n\nThe study was carried out in Murewa, a rural district town in Mashonaland\nEast province. It is considered a ZANU-PF stronghold, while tensions\nbetween ZANU-PF and MDC supporters increased over the last decade.\nMurewa was affected by the 2008 election violence, when people were\nforced to attend rallies at \u2018bases\u2019 run by war veterans and party affiliates,\nand some were subjected to torture.79 A prominent MDC politician,\nShepherd Jani, was abducted from Murewa and murdered before the 2008\npresidential run-off.80 The study was carried out over repeated visits\nbetween October 2013 and July 2014, and November 2015 to February\n2016.

Its proximity to Harare was useful for organizing all interviews\nand discussions in a private venue in order to avoid surveillance. As a small\ntown, it was suitable for the study as the linkages between political actors\nand the local economy could be easily identified.\nThe research team comprised of three Zimbabwean researchers from the\n\nResearch and Advocacy Unit, a civil society organization in Harare, and the\nauthor, a UK-based researcher. All researchers are adult professionals and have\nexperience with youth-focused research in Zimbabwe. In this context, research-\ners who come from the city can easily be perceived as government informants,\nor as urbanites who support the opposition. At the start of a research activity,\nresearchers spent time creating a comfortable atmosphere and agreed on\nground rules for focus groups about respect, and confidentiality. Utmost atten-\ntion was given to the formulation of questions and ways of probing, in order\nfor participants not to feel judged about their (potential) political affiliation.\nThe team first carried out 24 focus group discussions (FGDs), 12 with\n\nyoung women and 12 with young men, selected in collaboration with the\nCBO facilitator through snow-ball sampling, in order to organize separate\ngroups of unemployed and (self)employed participants who were peers and\nfriends in order to safeguard a confidential setting. We organized separate\ngroups for male and female participants, for different parts of the town centre.\nInvolving equal numbers of women and men allowed the team to explore how\nexperiences are gendered during data analysis. Through the partnership with\nthe local CBO, it was also possible to organize separate FGDs for youth sup-\nporting ZANU-PF and those supporting other parties. In the FGDs the team\nused a range of participatory and visual methods to map youth experiences of\ntheir political environment, and used structured discussions about how youth\nwent about finding work. Secondly, the team conducted individual interviews\nwith youth in the age group 18 to 30 (18 male respondents, 18 female respon-\ndents), using stratified sampling to include equal numbers of unemployed and\n(self)employed youth from different parts of Murewa centre. In the same way,\n10 male and 10 female respondents were selected for life history interviews,\nwhich focused on how they had taken decisions about economic opportun-\nities. Using these different methods enabled the triangulation of data.\nZimbabwean researchers spent a few days hanging out with self-employed\nyouth to engage in informal conversations.\n\nEveryday experiences of repression and politics\n\nZimbabwean scholarship has largely focused on the politically active and\norganized youth,81 but has paid less attention to others.

It also shows their awareness of risk in\nthe area, and how they avoid it.\n\nWhen discussing what it was like being young, participants would list\nthe nicknames used to label youth, such as idle, stubborn and thieves,\nunderscoring the lack of an intergenerational understanding. Most\nstrongly, they felt that the nickname \u2018born-frees\u2019 was effectively used to\ndelegitimize the opinion of youth because they did not fight in the liber-\nation war. All participants who were asked what it means to be a \u2018youth\u2019\nagreed that adults used the label \u2018youth\u2019 with reference to the likelihood of\nbecoming involved in opposition politics.82 A young woman said that\n\u2018They [the elders] don\u2019t consider their [the youth\u2019s] opinion because they\nassume all the youth are members of the MDC\u2019.83 Overall, youth were\nhighly dissatisfied with the dire economic situation, and disgruntled with\nempty promises by the government concerning youth funds.84 When dis-\ncussing the term \u2018born-free\u2019 two women commented: \u2018There is nothing\nlike born-free, we are fighting an economic war!\u201985 Repeatedly, youth\nwould refer to \u2018they\u2019 as the people in the government and incumbent party\nwho belong to the generation that was part of the liberation struggle, who\nhad let the youth down and filled their own pockets.\n\nAll young men and women described political violence as something\nseasonal: it intensified in the run up to national elections and then peaked,\nafter which normal life resumed. This was a period of \u2018heightened naviga-\ntion\u2019.86 Yet it became clear that forms of violence persisted during what\nthey described as the \u2018normal\u2019 periods in between elections. Particularly,\nthere was a permanent sense of being under surveillance, and the intimi-\ndation of (suspected) opposition supporters never really stopped, but\nchanged from overt intimidation to more subtle, yet detrimental forms of\nexclusion. Participants of 22 FGDs identified the headmen (sabhuku),\nyouth ward officers, active party youth, NYS graduates and war veterans\nas the main actors involved in intimidation and surveillance. Participants\nalso referred to the presence of state security actors and potential central\nintelligence officers (CIOs) in their communities, who monitored any\nform of political activity.\n\nMost research participants were old enough to have consciously experi-\nenced and witnessed the election violence of 2008, including at the\n\n82.

During the campaigns and elections in 2013, physical\nviolence had been minimal, and youth had only experienced intimidation\nand forced participation in rallies organized by ZANU-PF agents. They\nsaid that ZANU-PF affiliated actors sent out \u2018reminders\u2019 of the 2008 vio-\nlence to \u2018keep them in line\u2019 (i.e. vote ZANU-PF) by referring to \u2018giving\npeople short sleeves\u2019, which implied the cutting off of hands and arms, as\nthey said had happened in 2008.87 Early in 2014, youth identified the\nexclusion from access to economic resources, or threat thereof, as a major\nstrategy used to deter people from supporting the opposition and to harass\n(suspected) opposition supporters. During distributions, headmen, with\nthe help of NYS graduates and war veterans, identified what they referred\nto as \u2018errant families\u2019, who were subsequently excluded from receiving\nfarm inputs and food aid.88\n\nGiven the dominance of ZANU-PF in this area, and how youth were\neasily regarded as opposition, certain behaviours were considered risky.\nFor boys and young men in particular, it was difficult to get together\nsocially, as this might be interpreted as a political gathering. In public\nconversations, youth avoided topics such as government performance,\ncriticism of President Mugabe and ZANU-PF. The expression \u2018even the\nwalls have eyes and ears\u2019 frequently emerged in group discussions,89 sug-\ngesting that even the home is a state-captured space. One young man said\nthat a year after the 2013 elections:\n\nIn Murewa, they don\u2019t allow other parties. If you comment you might end up dead.

One woman said:\n\nIt is unacceptable to say you are not a party member, when they do not see you at meet-\nings, you have to strategize and justify the reasons for your absence.93\n\nMany youth also complied with ZANU-PF\u2019s informal rules and obtained\na membership card and attended political meetings, primarily to avoid\nany potential harm. Like Simone\u2019s notion of \u2018performative compliance\u2019,94\n\nthey disguised their opinions, as this woman illustrated:\n\nMy father is in the MDC and I am married into a family that supports ZANU-PF, so I\nattend ZANU-PF rallies. I don\u2019t feel safe because I stay among ZANU-PF members. I\nam forced to dance according to their tune, which I don\u2019t like. I campaigned for ZANU-\nPF. I joined them out of fear for intimidation.95\n\nAnother woman explained how she experienced ZANU-PF\u2019s dominance,\nsaying: \u2018Mwana wekwaminini anotoita zvinorehwa nemwana wekwamai-\nguru\u2019. This translates as: \u2018The younger sister\u2019s child does whatever she\u2019s\ntold to do by the older sister\u2019s child, however frivolous or abusive the\ndemands of the child of her mother\u2019s elder sister may be\u2019.96 The analogy\ndraws a parallel between social hierarchies in kinship relations and those\nthat exist in politics, with youth being integrated into both. The phrase\nexplains that a child needs to listen to his/her cousin if that cousin\u2019s\nmother (the aunt of the child) is the older sibling of the child\u2019s own\nmother, even if the cousin is younger in age. The older sister, or aunt,\nrepresents ZANU-PF, and thus if her child (youth) tells others to support\nZANU-PF, younger cousins will need to abide.\n\nObviously, youth who genuinely supported ZANU-PF, and openly\ndeclared it, had different perspectives. They spoke about the president as\n\u2018father of the nation\u2019, whereas opposition supporters were seen as the\n\u2018sell-outs\u2019 of the country.97 One young man endorsed the intimidation of\nopposition supporters in 2013, saying that ZANU-PF agents \u2018support\ntheir fathers [political leaders] against the enemy [the opposition] since\nthe country was at war\u2019.98 Further, some had benefited from their support\nto the ruling party, for instance in the form of loans to start a small\nbusiness.99\n\n93.

These dynamics were also clearly\nvisible when looking at the local economy.\n\nPolitics of the local economy\n\nWhat was striking about a small district town like Murewa was that many\neconomic opportunities were controlled by party-affiliated actors. This\nsection shows how youth assessed the political actors linked to economic\nopportunities, and how this required youth to navigate. It stresses the\nimportance of memories of past violence in shaping young people\u2019s assess-\nment of the present, thus developing Vigh\u2019s insights on how the present\nand future are linked through navigation.101\n\nMost people in and around Murewa lived off farming, and opportun-\nities for paid work were scarce. There were only a few large farms where\nsome youth occasionally found \u2018piece jobs\u2019 (maricho, temporary/seasonal\nwork). Larger businesses and companies have shut down over the last\ndecade.102 Murewa centre has a market and a range of shops and bars.\nThere were opportunities to work as hairdressers and builders, and\nyoung women could work as maids or occasional gardening and sewing.\nMany young men and women were trying to access opportunities, which\nwas important for their self-esteem,103 as this young man explained: \u2018I\ndo not want to wait for my parents to do everything for me. You cannot\nbe like a broiler which is fed and does nothing else.\u2019104 For young\nwomen, church activities were a major social activity and therefore they\nwanted to be able to contribute to church groups to increase their\nstanding.\nA small number of public sector jobs existed at the council, the health\n\nclinic, and the schools. Twenty-eight interviewees, from all political affilia-\ntions, emphasized that especially for public sector jobs, one had to be a\nZANU-PF member, preferably an active member, and with connections\n\n100.

Daniel\nGarwe was a former ZANU-PF activists who lost the ZANU-PF primary\nelections and then ran as an independent candidate during the parliamentary\nelections, but lost again. To reward the youth who campaigned for him, and\nopenly stating that ZANU-PF would no longer help them, he employed\nyouth in his construction firm in Harare, and in his wife\u2019s local firm.107\n\nZANU-PF parliamentarian for Murewa, Ladislus Ndoro, employed youth at\nhis tobacco farm. Finally, Simbaneuta Mudarikwa used to be the ZANU-PF\nsecretary of finance for Mashonaland East, but was ousted from the party in\nNovember 2014. He owned a number of businesses. Young people\u2019s views\nof Mudarikwa were shaped by allegations that he was centrally involved in\ninstigating and coordinating the 2008 election violence.108 The well-known\npolitician Tendai Biti (MDC-T\u2019s Minister of Finance 2009\u20132013, a PDP\nleader) employed many youth when he constructed his farm in Murewa. A\nwoman who participated in the construction work claimed that Biti had said\nhe wanted to help youth regardless of their political affiliation, while she also\nheld that it was his strategy to build support for the new party.109\n\nWhen ZANU-PF organized local party meetings, shops and markets\nhad to close and the staff had to attend. Anyone who did not attend risked\nbeing \u2018singled out\u2019 or \u2018labelled\u2019 as opposition supporters.110 Shopkeepers\ninterviewed reported the longstanding practice of blacklisting business-\npeople who were (suspected) opposition supporters, and the local ZANU-\nPF leadership instructed people to boycott them.111 A young male traders\nwho supported ZANU-PF said: \u2018We just have to attend meetings and ral-\nlies so that we are on the safe side. We all do our businesses with ZANU-\nPF in mind, because if we display any form of rebellion, we will get in\ntrouble\u2019.112 This quote signals how politics pervade the local economy\nand that youth assess partisan actors to inform their actions.\n\n105.

Youth reported that people belonging to Biti\u2019s PDP\nhad given youth money and promised to set up businesses, and some\nyouth had joined what some referred to as this \u2018new MDC\u2019.113 According\nto study participants, ZANU-PF suspected that the presence of Tendai\nBiti harnessed support for PDP among especially the youth. This man\nsaid: \u2018The headman thinks that we are using our money or help other\nyouths from the community to mobilize youths to take part in MDC\u2019.114\n\nA shop owner, who is a distant relative of Biti, was harassed so much that\nshe had to close her shop and leave Murewa for some time in 2013.115\n\nAccording to ten interviewees interviewed in 2015, ZANU-PF agents\nseemed more concerned about Joyce Mujuru gaining support in Murewa\nthan the PDP.116 Mujuru\u2019s late husband General Solomon Mujuru, a\npowerful army chief, was from Mashonaland East province, and she her-\nself had earned liberation war credentials.117 They felt that, unlike the\nMDC, she might persuade rural populations to support her. Some of the\nZANU-PF supporting traders noted that now, if you did not attend ral-\nlies, you would be labelled Gamatox, and excluded from farming inputs\nby headmen.118 A young man illustrated how risky he felt the situation\nhad become:\n\nTwo weeks ago a shop was burnt because he [owner] had joined a new political party\ncalled People First, led by Mujuru. They wrote at the [shop] door that \u2018pasi negamatokisi\u2019\n[down with Gamatox]. Murewa is not a clean area; it has got ngozi [bad spirits].119 People\nin Murewa were killed [in 2008] and some had their hands cut off; the long sleeves and\nshort sleeves. There was a man who was taken away from the Murewa centre. His name is\n[Shepherd] Jani [MDC politician]. After three days the man was found dead.120\n\nHe elaborated how, since Mujuru formed her party, ZANU-PF agents\nwanted to send out a clear message to others. The way this young man\nrelated the tensions between \u2018weevils\u2019 and \u2018Gamatox\u2019 to the 2008 election\nviolence is therefore important. It reflected his assessment of how risky it\nwas to end up on \u2018the wrong side\u2019 (a phrase many participants used), and\nhow experiences from historical memory shaped young people\u2019s current\n\n113.

A young male vendor provided\nanother example of the implications of factionalism:\n\nI have a true story from a friend of mine whom I helped. He had a barber shop and people\nwere banned from getting into his barber shop. There was a label [note stuck on the door]\nwhich says \u2018If anyone get into this barber shop his/her head will be cut off when the time\ncomes\u2019. My friend had a position in the new MDC.121\n\nHere, the phrase \u2018when the time comes\u2019 signalled the next elections, thus\nthose involved in intimidation actively invoked memories of past election\nviolence as a strategy to instil fear, similar to the reference to \u2018short\nsleeves\u2019.\n\nThe language youth used to describe their situation clearly communi-\ncated the repressive environment: partisan actors might support people\nwith the right \u2018credentials\u2019, while they \u2018blacklist\u2019 businessmen and \u2018single\nout\u2019 the \u2018rebels\u2019, \u2018sell-outs\u2019 and \u2018errant families\u2019. By late 2015, party fac-\ntionalism complicated the political landscape and prompted increased sur-\nveillance by ZANU-PF. Findings in this section already suggested how\nyouth need to navigate this context, and the next section elaborates the\nrange of tactics youth used for social navigation.\n\nSocial navigation: resisting, avoiding, or staying on good terms?\n\nIn Zimbabwe, fault lines in the political landscape have been deep and, as\nshown, there were clear risks and implications for people who became\nassociated with the \u2018wrong side\u2019. Social navigation in this context was\nabout how to avoid being labelled a \u2018rebel\u2019, or calculating the risks and\nopportunities of resistance or compliance. The vast majority of youth in\nMurewa, including those supporting ZANU-PF, opted for risk avoidance\nstrategies. Importantly, this was also about mitigating the risk of being\nmobilized into violence by party agents. Young men felt they were more\nlikely to be targeted by partisan actors looking to mobilize youth, but the\nfindings show that young women were just as cautious.\n\nMany self-employed youth who needed to protect their businesses tried\nto appear as neutral as possible to avoid harassment and secure a clientele,\nas this vendor explained:\n\nI am not a member of any political party. I taught myself not to be involved in politics\nbecause if people know which party you support those supporting the other party will not\nbuy from you. [\u2026] At the market we do not want people to know which party we support.\nI will never wear party regalia.122\n\n121. FGD, men, Murewa, 4 February 2016.\n122.

They boycotted shops and\nfarms that were run by people they knew as active ZANU-PF members.\nOne shop owner explained how he felt he was \u2018marked\u2019 \u2013 seen locally as\n\nan opposition supporter \u2013 although he claimed not to support any\nparty.124 He refused to close his shop and attend ZANU-PF meetings. As\na result, he claimed that ZANU-PF has instructed residents not to buy\nfrom him. Another participant, the owner of a small but successful enter-\nprise, described resisting ZANU-PF\u2019s dominance by avoiding any form of\ndependency on the party. He deliberately tried to sustain a network of\nbuyers and suppliers that were independent from the party through the\nchurch, while avoiding any rumour about his political ideas.125 This\nunderscored the importance of sustaining certain social relationships,\nwhile avoiding others, when navigating.\nJob seekers needed to perform compliance as they may need sabhuku or\n\nyouth ward officers, or other intermediaries, to access future work oppor-\ntunities, for instance to obtain reference letters, and were asked to prove\nthat they genuinely support ZANU-PF.126\n\nI should have a letter from the councillor, headman or chairman if I want to look for a\njob. If the chairman or councillor does not like you he will not give you the letter he can\njust say come back another day. He can even say he is busy or even tell you that you are\ntroublesome and he cannot help you. If there has been a rumour that you support MDC,\nhe will not help you at all.127\n\nWhen approaching potential employers or mediators, they also assessed\nthe potential effects of these individuals\u2019 political affiliation on how they\nmight be viewed in the community. Yet some youth chose to pretend to\nbe a supporter of the party of the potential employer, and as a ZANU-PF\nsupporter when approaching the sabhuku.

In 2015, male youth in particular recounted \u2018party swapping\u2019\nand trying to develop relationships to employers linked to the different\nopposition parties in order to \u2018go with the wind\u2019. Party swapping, how-\never, was considered highly risky business for ZANU-PF supporters now\nsiding with Mujuru.\n\nA minority of self-employed youth openly supported MDC-T, MDC-\nRenewal or (later) PDP. One of the vendors commented: \u2018I have learnt\none thing \u2013 once you are in, you cannot go back\u2019.128 In order to keep their\nbusinesses thriving, they needed to rely on each other for support and cli-\nentele, since they were boycotted by ZANU-PF supporters. One self-\nemployed man explained he and his mates approached MDC-Renewal for\nequipment for their businesses. In return, he became actively involved in\nthe party:\n\nI need to be aware of politics to keep my business running. There are certain rules I need\nto stick to: being active and attending most of the meetings so that you are familiar and\nknown in the party. It will be easier to ask for help if you are an active member. Many of\nmy customers are into politics and we support the same party, MDC-Renewal. [\u2026] I got\ninvolved with them, because many do the same kind of work. When it comes to politicians\nfrom the ruling party, we are water and oil. Our party is still new, our leaders said they do\nnot have much to offer at the moment, but they help us link up with job opportunities.129\n\nConsequently, he was paid a visit by unknown men, whom he believed\nwere ZANU-PF members, and received warning letters saying \u2018uchatsvira\nmumba\u2019 (\u2018you will burn in your house\u2019) and \u2018uchashayika\u2019 (\u2018you will dis-\nappear forever\u2019, meaning die). To cope, he started spending the night\nelsewhere. Another MDC-Renewal supporter stated that although he sup-\nported the party, he did not accept any offers from its local leadership to\nassist with his poultry business. He alluded to avoiding the potential\nmobilization into violence, when saying:\n\nIf that happens [accepting support] what will tie me to these politicians is that they will\nstart using me to their advantage. \u2026 I have never heard of a politician that just goes with-\nout expecting something.130\n\nThe fourteen ZANU-PF supporters who participated in our study said\nthey were on good terms with local ZANU-PF actors, and could ask them\nfor jobs and submit proposals for youth funds.131 Even ZANU-PF sup-\nporters often did not feel safe in the current political climate, however.\nThose who had previously been able to make up excuses for not attending\nparty meetings, now described making sure they attended every meeting\n\n128.

Overall, it seemed a sense\nof disillusionment prevailed among ZANU-PF youth:\n\nI joined the ZANU-PF party in 2008. The promises which were made motivated us to\njoin. Personally, I joined the party because I hoped to acquire funds to start my own pro-\nject. It was all talk without any action. I was the youth secretary for a very long time. We\nwere promised a lot of things but nothing is fulfilled for us youths, while we fulfilled our\nduty to support the party.132\n\nSome of the relatively active ZANU-PF members felt that they were being\noverlooked. They were aware that the party leadership distributed benefits\nand resources to the inner circle and their relatives. As this woman indi-\ncated: \u2018The problem is that only a fraction of the party members benefit\nwhilst the rest within the party are side-lined. You should at least see the\nbenefit of your sweat\u2019.133 However, all fourteen ZANU-PF supporters\nindicated that they preferred \u2018a backseat\u2019, as joining the inner-circle would\ninevitably increase the risk of being called upon when things got \u2018messy\u2019\n(during elections).134 Thus, even youth affiliated to political parties were\nnavigating: they assessed the trade-offs between short-term material gains\nand the longer term risk of being drawn into potentially violent politics.\nWhilst they had entered a relationship with the party, they tried to avoid\ngetting too close.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Zimbabwe, politicians and officials aligned with the ruling party have\nsignificant control over the public sphere and economic resources.

This adds to Jones\u2019 rich study on the kukiya-kiya economy\nas well as Kamete\u2019s studies on the informal economy in Zimbabwe, by\nemphasizing the need to manoeuvre partisan actors.136 By highlighting\nhow memories of violence in the past shaped young people\u2019s assessment\nof the current situation, the study contends that navigation does not only\nlink the present to the anticipated future,137 but also connects to the past.\nWhile sustaining social relationships to powerful actors constitutes one\nform of social navigation known in (post)conflict settings,138 this study\nshowed that many youth carefully avoided getting too close to party agents\nor avoid relationships to partisan actors altogether. They thus refused\nopportunities contrary to popular beliefs about violent, opportunistic\nyouth.139 The manipulation of economic opportunities by political actors \u2013\nand the patronage relationships they seek to establish \u2013 played a major role\nin mobilizing youth into violence, more than unemployment per se, but\nmany youth did try to avoid this capture.140 As elsewhere, organizational\ndelineations of parties mattered strongly for how youth were mobilized or\ntargeted, while ideology over what constitutes patriotism also mattered.141\n\nThe findings underscore the need to understand how youth who live in vio-\nlent contexts respond to violence mobilization, which requires a shift in\nfocus away from the conventional emphasis in research on youth who are\nmobilized in violent groups.142\n\nThrough the concept of \u2018the everyday\u2019, this study showed that social\nnavigation by youth in Murewa was informed by their embodied knowl-\nedge of \u2018politicized youth\u2019. This in itself was a product of the regime\u2019s\nstrategies for consolidating its power; the ways in which it has contributed\nto constructions of youth as violent as well as \u2018born-frees\u2019 and \u2018sell-outs\u2019.\n\n136.

Like the youth in these other counties, Zimbabwean\nyouth have grown frustrated with a regime that makes claims on authority\nbecause of its liberation history, while failing to deliver services, and edu-\ncational and employment opportunities.144 Youth have started to chal-\nlenge the meaning of \u2018born-free\u2019, but while forms of protest have emerged\nin urban centres in recent years, youth have not engaged to the same\nextent in massprotests or riots as their \u2018peers\u2019 elsewhere.145 At least for\nnow, the repressive environment and memories of violence have prompted\nmany of them, especially outside of urban centres, to opt for mainly non-\nconfrontational tactics, avoiding the likelihood of violence through navigation.\n\n143.
