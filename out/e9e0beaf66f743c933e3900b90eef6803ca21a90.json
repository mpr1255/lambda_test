ZIVOTOFSKY v. KERRY. 135 S.Ct. 2076.\nUnited States Supreme Court, June 8, 2015.\n\nIn Zivotofsky v. Kerry,1 decided June 8, 2015, the United States Supreme Court (Court) held\nunconstitutional a federal statute that permitted U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to designate\n\u201cIsrael\u201d as their place of birth on their passports,2 notwithstanding the secretary of state\u2019s deci-\nsion that such passports should designate \u201cJerusalem\u201d as the place of birth. The opinion\nresolved a relatively narrow question of law (the constitutionality of an unusual statute), but\nthe justices\u2019 reasoning and language are of potentially broad significance and will provide fod-\nder for many doctrinal debates in U.S. foreign relations law.\n\nThe plaintiff, Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky, was born to U.S. citizens living in Jerusa-\nlem. His parents, exercising their statutory right, requested that the Department of State list\nZivotofsky\u2019s place of birth as \u201cIsrael\u201d on his passport. The State Department refused. In an\neffort to remain neutral in the sensitive political debates about sovereignty over Jerusalem, the\ndepartment instead followed long-standing U.S. policy by listing the place of birth as \u201cJeru-\nsalem.\u201d Zivotofsky sued.\n\nThe first court to consider Zivotofsky\u2019s case held both that it presented a nonjusticiable\npolitical question and that Zivotofsky lacked standing.3 These two closely related doctrines\nensure that the federal courts hear only disputes well suited to judicial resolution. As to stand-\ning, the district court reasoned that Zivotofsky had alleged only a conjectural harm, not an\nactual or imminent injury, from having Jerusalem listed as the place of birth on his passport.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that the inva-\nsion of the statutory right to have Israel listed itself creates standing, even when the plaintiff\nwould otherwise have suffered no cognizable injury.4 In its first consideration of the dispute,\nthe Supreme Court did not address the standing issue5 but held in an 8-1 decision that the\npolitical question doctrine did not bar Zivotofsky\u2019s claim (Zivotofsky I ).6 The case was\ntherefore returned to the lower court for a determination on the merits. The D.C. Circuit\nthen held the statute unconstitutional because it conflicted with a long-standing presidential\n\n1 Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v.

The government emphasized the foreign policy implications of the case,\nespecially in support of the argument that the statute conflicted with the president\u2019s exclusive\npowers. It maintained, for example, that listing \u201cIsrael\u201d on the passports of U.S. citizens born\nin Jerusalem who so request could \u201csignificantly harm \u2018U.S. national security interests,\u2019 and\n\u2018cause irreversible damage\u2019 to the United States\u2019 ability to facilitate the peace process\u201d between\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians.8\n\nAt oral argument, several justices voiced considerable skepticism about that last proposition.\nJustice Kennedy asked why the government did not simply issue a disclaimer stating that the\npassport designation was not a \u201cformal recognition\u201d of the status of Jerusalem.9 The chief jus-\ntice and Justices Scalia and Alito were also openly skeptical about the solicitor general\u2019s enu-\nmeration of the foreign policy consequences of a decision in Zivotofsky\u2019s favor. The chief jus-\ntice maintained, for example, that the government itself had made a \u201cbig deal\u201d out of the statute\nwhen President George H. Bush attached a signing statement noting that the statute impli-\ncated the president\u2019s exclusive recognition power, and Justice Alito questioned whether the\nconstitutionality of the statute could really hinge on the possibility that some people would\nmisunderstand the meaning of the passport designation of place of birth.10 On the basis of the\noral argument, it seemed plausible that the government would lose in a classic partisan 5-4 split,\nwith all the conservatives as well as Justice Kennedy voting in favor of Zivotofsky.\n\nBut the government won. Justice Thomas wrote separately but voted with the liberals, per-\nhaps surprising some scholars. Justice Thomas, however, has a generally expansive view of exec-\nutive power in foreign relations and national security cases.11 Justice Kennedy wrote the major-\nity opinion for himself and the four liberal justices. After reviewing the history of the case and\nnoting that it falls within Youngstown category 3,12 his opinion analyzed in turn (1) whether\nthe president has the power to recognize foreign nations and governments, (2) whether that\npower is exclusive, and (3) whether the statute infringes on that power.\n\n7 Zivotofsky ex rel.

On the second issue, the majority held that the pres-\nident\u2019s recognition power is exclusive, citing \u201cfunctional considerations\u201d (including the need\nfor the nation to speak with \u201cone voice\u201d) (p. 2086), as well as prior decisional law and the prac-\ntice of Congress and the president. The majority acknowledged that \u201cno single precedent\nresolves\u201d the exclusivity question and that each category of evidence includes counter-examples\n(p. 2088).13 The dissenters expressed doubt about the majority\u2019s exclusivity analysis but did\nnot reach the issue because they concluded that the statute did not in any event infringe upon\nthe recognition power.\n\nThe third issue was therefore the crux of the disagreement between the majority and the dis-\nsenting opinions. The majority acknowledged that the birthplace designation required by the\nstatute is not itself a formal act of recognition. The majority also defined the exclusive recog-\nnition power narrowly to extend no further than the act of recognition itself. The conflict, the\nmajority reasoned, arises because the passport designation \u201ccontradicts\u201d the president\u2019s earlier\nrecognition determination (p. 2095). If the passport is not a statement of recognition, what\ngenerates the conflict? According to the majority, the long-standing view of the executive\nbranch is that the passport designation can undercut its recognition decisions; Congress\u2019s pur-\npose in enacting the statute was to undermine the president\u2019s policy on Jerusalem; and inter-\nnational law requires that recognition be unequivocal. The dissenting opinions found no con-\nflict between the designation required by the statute and the power of recognition.\n\n* * * *\n\nThe Zivotofsky opinions are notable in part for their reliance on international law to define\nthe scope of the president\u2019s constitutional power over recognition. Recognition was a consti-\ntutionally significant category for all nine justices, and modern international law helps deter-\nmine the meaning and scope of this category, again for all nine justices. As Justice Thomas accu-\nrately noted in his opinion: \u201c[T]he majority [assumes] that the recognition power conferred\non the President by the Constitution is the power to accomplish the act of recognition as that\nact is defined under international law.\u201d14 The majority opinion defined recognition as a \u201c \u2018for-\nmal acknowledgement\u2019 that a particular \u2018entity possesses the qualifications for statehood\u2019 or\n\u2018that a particular regime is the effective government of a state.\u2019 \u201d15 The case did not involve a\ndispute about Israel\u2019s statehood or legitimate government but, instead, an underlying dispute\nover whether Jerusalem is part of Israel. Thus, the Court, relying only on a contemporary inter-\nnational law treatise, made this addition to the definition of recognition: \u201cIt may also involve\nthe determination of a state\u2019s territorial bounds.\u201d16 In addition, the majority opinion used\n\n13 Indeed, the contrary evidence has led the leading scholar on the topic to conclude that the recognition power\nis not exclusive.

Justice Thomas shared the major-\nity\u2019s assumption that the recognition power is the power to recognize as defined at international law because there\nis no evidence that the modern practice is different from the historical practice, nor is there evidence \u201cthat the orig-\ninal understanding of the recognition power was something other than the power to take part in that practice.\u201d Id.\n\n15 Id. at 2084 (majority opinion) (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW OF THE\nUNITED STATES \u00a7203 cmt. a, at 84 (1986)).\n\n16 Id.

The Court reasoned that implied recognition takes place through the con-\nclusion of a bilateral treaty or through the \u201c \u2018formal initiation of diplomatic relations,\u2019 includ-\ning the dispatch of an ambassador,\u201d citing international law in support.17 The various methods\nof implied recognition, in turn, are granted by the Constitution to the president through the\npowers to negotiate treaties, to nominate ambassadors, and to dispatch other diplomatic agents\n(pp. 2085\u201386). These textual grants of power to the president say nothing about recognition,\nof course. International law provides the link between these sections of the Constitution\u2014\nwhich the Court describes as constitutional structure\u2014and the recognition power.\n\nJustice Scalia, in a dissenting opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, relied\non international law to conclude that the statute does not infringe upon the recognition power.\n\u201cRecognition,\u201d Justice Scalia reasoned, \u201cis a formal legal act with effects under international\nlaw.\u201d18 To extend recognition, a \u201cstate must perform an act that unequivocally manifests that\nintention.\u201d19 With this understanding in place, Justice Scalia argued, it is obvious that the stat-\nute has \u201cnothing to do with recognition,\u201d because it requires no formal declaration about\nIsrael\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem, nor does \u201cinternational custom infer[ ] acceptance of sov-\nereignty from the birthplace designation on a passport or birth report, as it does from bilateral\ntreaties or exchanges of ambassadors.\u201d20\n\nThe majority opinion also used international law as part of its functional reasoning to sup-\nport the conclusions that the president\u2019s recognition power is exclusive and that the statute con-\nflicts with that exclusive power. In support of its exclusivity analysis, the Court reasoned that\nthe president is better positioned than Congress to take \u201cthe decisive, unequivocal action nec-\nessary to recognize other states at international law\u201d (p. 2086). These qualities, Justice Kennedy\nexplained, are why the framers assigned to the president \u201cthe traditional avenues of\nrecognition\u2014receiving ambassadors, making treaties, and sending ambassadors\u201d (id.).\n\nFunctional reasoning was at the core of the Court\u2019s conclusion that the statute infringes on\nthe president\u2019s exclusive recognition power and the Court relied upon international law to sup-\nport this conclusion as well. The justices all noted that under international law an act of rec-\nognition must be clear and unequivocal, leaving no doubt about the intention to grant it. Jus-\ntice Scalia concluded on this basis that the statute, which is not an unequivocal act of\nrecognition, did not implicate recognition at all. The majority opinion relied on the same attri-\nbutes of recognition under international law to conclude the opposite: that the statute did\ninfringe upon the president\u2019s recognition power, because that power must be exercised\nunequivocally so that \u201cthe President not only makes the initial, formal recognition determi-\nnation but also . . . may maintain that determination in his and his agent\u2019s statements\u201d\n(pp. 2094\u201395).\n\n17 Id. at 2085\u201386 (quoting IAN BROWNLIE, PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW 93 (7th ed. 2008),\nand citing 1 Moore DIGEST \u00a727, at 73 (1906)).\n\n18 Id. at 2118 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing Convention on Rights and Duties of States, Art. 6, Dec. 26, 1933,\n49 Stat. 3097, 165 LNTS 19).\n\n19 Id.

First, it spans several implicit and explicit methodologies used by the Court: originalism,\ntextualism, constitutional structure, and functionalism.21 Second, the opinions relied on con-\ntemporary international law as a tool of constitutional interpretation, a practice that has drawn\ncontroversy, but with the exception of Justice Thomas, the justices provided no methodolog-\nical reason for doing so; nor did any of the justices explicitly consider whether the modern inter-\nnational law they rely upon has the same relevant content today as it did in the late eighteenth\ncentury.22 Third, international law was unusually central to the Court\u2019s reasoning. The terms\n\u201cCaptures\u201d and \u201cDeclare War\u201d are (or were), like \u201crecognition,\u201d important terms in interna-\ntional law, so that international law informs their interpretation;23 but unlike \u201crecognition,\u201d\nthey are also part of the text of the Constitution. \u201cRecognition\u201d is not a constitutional term but\na category of conduct defined by international law. As a category, recognition now has great\nconstitutional significance, of course, for conduct that falls within this category is reserved\nexclusively for the president, just as if the term \u201crecognition\u201d appeared in the text of the Con-\nstitution. Although international law in constitutional interpretation boasts a strong historical\npedigree,24 in no contemporary case (and few historical ones) has international law played such\na central role in interpreting the Constitution. All in all, the case offers a strong endorsement\nof international law in constitutional interpretation.\n\nA second notable aspect of the case is what it means for the Court\u2019s approach to foreign rela-\ntions law generally. There is strong evidence that the Court is \u201cnormalizing\u201d its treatment of\nforeign relations issues, meaning that it analyzes foreign relations in the same ways that it ana-\nlyzes domestic issues.25 By contrast, an \u201cexceptionalist\u201d approach to foreign relations cases,\noften associated with the Court\u2019s broad dicta in Curtiss-Wright,26 is characterized by judicial\nreluctance to resolve foreign relations cases, a high level of deference to the executive branch,\nand broad power of the federal government at the expense of the states. The Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Zivotofsky I rejecting the political question doctrine and forcing a resolution of the\ncase on the merits took a significant step toward normalization.\n\nThe significance of Zivotofsky II for normalization is less clear. The Court held for the exec-\nutive branch, and expansive executive power over foreign relations is one aspect of exception-\nalism, not normalization. The Court\u2019s reasoning is also functional at times, and functional rea-\nsoning has historically been associated with the courts\u2019 exceptional treatment of foreign\n\n21 For a defense of using changing norms of international law in separation-of-powers cases as part of a functional\nanalysis or to evaluate the past practice of the executive branch, see Ingrid Brunk Wuerth, International Law and\nConstitutional Interpretation: The Commander in Chief Clause Reconsidered, 106 MICH. L. REV. 61, 76\u201382 (2007).\nThe Court in Zivotofsky could have also used international law to interpret the historical interaction of Congress\nand the president over recognition.

In addition, the Court relied upon United States v. Bel-\nmont and United States v. Pink, 27 decisions that gave the president the power to make domestic\nlaw through executive claims settlement agreements, a power the president lacks in the domes-\ntic context. In these ways, Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion for a five-justice majority does not support\nnormalization.\n\nIn other ways, however, the decision does support the normalization of foreign relations law.\nFor example, the Court decided the case on the narrow reasoning that the president has the\nexclusive power to recognize foreign states and foreign governments, not on the broader argu-\nment advanced by the government that the president has \u201c \u2018exclusive authority to conduct dip-\nlomatic relations,\u2019 along with \u2018the bulk of foreign-affairs powers.\u2019 \u201d28 The Court pointedly\nrejected the government\u2019s argument, but it did so at the price of analytical clarity later in the\nopinion. Relying solely on the president\u2019s recognition power meant that the Court must\nexplain how the statute conflicts with the recognition power, a strained analysis heavily crit-\nicized in the dissenting opinions. Had the Court accepted the government\u2019s argument that the\npresident enjoys exclusive power to conduct diplomatic relations, the conflict between the stat-\nute and the president\u2019s power would have been far clearer, because passports are a form of dip-\nlomatic communication whether or not they relate to recognition. The narrow reading of the\npresident\u2019s power was unquestionably a deliberate choice by the majority and one that came\nat the cost of weak analysis on a central issue in the litigation.\n\nThe decision also supports normalization because both the majority and the dissenting opin-\nions disavowed exceptionalist language in Curtiss-Wright. The Court did use functional rea-\nsoning in favor of the president elsewhere in its opinion, leading some scholars to question\nwhether the Court meant what it said in its repudiation of the Curtiss-Wright dicta.29 But there\nis less tension between these parts of the opinion than some of the commentary suggests. The\nCourt\u2019s functional reasoning in Zivotofsky II is more narrowly tailored to recognition and to\nthe facts of this case than the Court\u2019s broad dicta in Curtiss-Wright. Thus, the Court focuses\non the nation\u2019s need to speak with \u201cone voice\u201d specifically on the topic of recognition, not with\nrespect to foreign relations generally (p. 2086). The Court uses functional reasoning in non-\nforeign relations cases, too, so narrowly tailored functional analysis is a move toward normal-\nization. Future litigants and political actors will certainly use the functional analysis from Zivo-\ntofsky outside the narrow context of recognition30\u2014but whether they will be successful is an\nissue for another day and another case.\n\nFinally, through its decision in Zivotofsky I, the Court interjected itself into the middle of\na long-standing and difficult foreign policy issue\u2014the status of Jerusalem\u2014signaling its\nunwillingness to sit on the sidelines when it comes to foreign policy. There were good reasons\nnot to grant certiorari in this difficult case, especially because the Court ultimately affirmed the\ndecision of the D.C. Circuit, but the Roberts Court appears to enjoy high-profile separation-\nof-powers cases,31 whether or not they involve foreign relations.\n\n27 United States v.
