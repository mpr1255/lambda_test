The UN has made a global appeal for all countries to mitigate their impact\non the environment. Marine environmental protection is one of the most critical and urgent issues in the\nworld and many countries have commenced establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) by implement-\ning ecosystem-based management (EBM) concepts. MPA planning has been considered one of the\nsimplest and most effective methods to protect marine environments. Taiwan has recently developed\npolicies that have focused on its marine environment, and there are plans to increase the size of Taiwan's\nMPAs to 20% of its total ocean territory by 2020, thereby achieving a sustainable ocean. To achieve this\ngoal, the government must address specific difficulties associated with the location of MPAs and relevant\nzoning strategies. This study establishes MPA protection principles and a zoning framework for MPAs in\nTaiwan by using Gueishan Island in Yilan County as a case study site to examine specific zoning\nstrategies. The protection of 3 objectives (hydrothermal vents, cetacean, and fisheries resources) is\ndiscussed in this paper. Multi-criteria spatial analysis and a geographic information system are applied to\nidentify the most crucial area to protect. To understand the stakeholders' opinions and concerns\nregarding the proposed zoning framework, this research conducted in-depth interviews with experts\nand stakeholders. MPAs zoning strategies are formulated at the conclusion of this study that could assist\nin protecting critical marine resources and avoiding conflicts among various usages of the marine area.\n\n& 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nIn addition to the growth in the global population and devel-\nopments in fishing technology, human activities have extended to\nocean areas, and the demand for marine resources has increased.\nAccording to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report from\nthe United Nations (UN), there has been a decline in global\nbiodiversity. All oceans are affected by human activities, including\nover-fishing, ocean dumping, mining, transportation, aquaculture,\nand tourism [1]. The UN has appealed to all countries, requesting\naction to mitigate the impacts of human activities on the marine\nenvironment. Researchers have indicated that the traditional\nmethodology for fishing management based on the concept of\nmaximum sustainable yield is unsuitable and inflexible for the\ncomplex and multi-use marine space. In addition, the decrease in\nglobal capture fisheries production pushes the emergence princi-\nple and approach toward the precautionary concept of marine\n\nresources protection. Therefore, the protection of marine resources\nhas been discussed from the perspective of ecosystem-based\nmanagement (EBM). In the past few decades, studies on EBM have\nfocused on the management of fisheries resources and other\nnatural resources. Numerous EBM-based studies have indicated\nthat the zoning of marine protected areas (MPAs) and related\nnetwork systems is a practical and effective approach to managing\nand protecting the marine environment [2\u20135].\n\nThe concept of MPAs is based on terrestrial protection, and the\nterm was first proposed in 1962 at the First World Conference on\nNational Parks. The goal of establishing MPAs is to maintain\nbiodiversity, ensure sustainable resource use, and to protect culture\nand heritage [6]. With a deeper understanding of the marine\nenvironment and improvements in technology, previous studies\nhave clarified several substantial differences between terrestrial\nand marine environments [3,6,7]. Accordingly, the planning, zon-\ning, and management strategies for MPAs should differ from those\nof terrestrial protected areas. Furthermore, such strategies should\nconsider the tidal and ocean currents, the complexity of oceanol-\nogy, and the four-dimensional marine characteristics, including\n3 dimensional space and time (Table 1). In addition, because MPAs\nare affected considerably by the surroundings, an effective MPA\n\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\n\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/marpol\n\nMarine Policy\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2014.03.001\n0308-597X/& 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This increases the difficulty of planning and\nmanaging MPAs.\n\nTaiwan is located in the center of the Festoon Islands, and has\nhigh biodiversity and rich fisheries resources. However, previous\nresearch has shown that overfishing, overcapacity, and land\npollution have caused the degradation of marine resources [4,8].\nIn 2006, the MPA concept was proposed in the Ocean Policy White\nPaper in Taiwan. In that paper, several sites (Green Island,\nGueishan Island, Penghu Islands, and the Three Northern Islands)\nwere listed as potential MPAs. In 2007, the Marine National Park\nHeadquarters was established, and commenced the establishment\nof Taiwan's first Marine National Park (Dongsha Atoll National\nPark). Apart from Marine National Park Headquarters, there are no\nparticular laws and regulations named from MPAs; consequently,\nmarine protection and related regulations have been dispersed\nacross various laws, such as the Wildlife Conservation Act and the\nFisheries Act. In 2009, the Sustainable Development Policy Guide-\nlines proposed increasing the size of the MPAs to 20% of Taiwan's\nterritorial waters ( inside the 12 nautical miles) by 2020, 50% of\nwhich should be marine reserves or no-take zones [9]. Three\nmajor challenges for establishing MPAs in Taiwan are (a) location\nand zoning methodology, (b) conflicts among the various stake-\nholders, and (c) multi-protection objectives.\n\nIn this study, specific zoning strategies are developed to assist\nin establishing MPAs in Taiwan. To address the difficulties asso-\nciated with the zoning of MPAs, this study focuses on the following\nthree major issues: (a) the difference between the zoning pro-\ncesses for marine and terrestrial protection; (b) commonalities\nand conflicts among the various protection objectives and criteria;\nand (c) the visualization of marine spatial models. The marine\ngeographic information system is applied to analyze and zone the\nfour-dimensional protected areas, and the method of spatial multi-\ncriteria analysis (SMCA) is incorporated into the spatial planning to\naddress the various objectives and criteria. In-depth interviews\n\nwere conducted to assess the concerns of various stakeholders\nregarding the potential objectives.\n\n2. Study area\n\nLocated off the northeast of Taiwan, Gueishan Island and its\nsurrounding waters are a potential site for establishing MPAs, as\nproposed in the Ocean Policy White Paper. Gueishan Island is\napproximately 10 km from Taiwan's coast, and the highest point\non the island is 398 m above sea level (Fig. 1). Because no specific\nmethods and criteria exist that define and calculate the coverage\narea of MPAs in Taiwan, it is critical to set a physical study\nboundary to estimate the covered area of the MPAs in Taiwan's\nterritorial waters [10]. Based on considering both the adminis-\ntrative boundary and border of various stakeholders, the study\narea includes Gueishan Island and its surrounding waters accord-\ning to the Toucheng Township fishing rights and the delineation of\nterritorial waters in Taiwan. The Toucheng Township fishing rights\narea is 3 nautical miles from the high-tide line, which includes\nGueishan Island. Therefore, the northern and southern boundaries\nof the study area are extensions of the fishing rights area (north\nfrom the SanDiaoJiao and south to the Lanyang Estuary), and the\neastern boundary extends 12 nautical miles from the baseline\n(Fig. 1). The study area covers approximately 732 km2, including\nthe territorial waters, inner waters, and Gueishan Island, and its\nmaximum depth is approximately 800 m.\n\nThe Kuroshio current and diverse geographical features along\nthe east coast of Taiwan provide abundant fisheries resources in\nproximity to Gueishan Island. From an economic perspective, the\nstudy site is one of the major fishing grounds in Taiwan, and\nvarious highly economically valuable fishery species inhabit this\narea for feeding, spawning, or migrating along the current. The\nabundant food resources and geographic location between the\ncontinental shelf and slope also attracts whales and dolphins.\n\nTable 1\nThe difference between marine and terrestrial protected areas [6,7].\n\nCharacteristic Terrestrial protected areas Marine protected areas\n\nSpatial concept \ufffd Two- to three-dimensional space \ufffd Three- to four-dimensional space\n\ufffd Zones with various depths need\n\ndifferent management strategies\n\nReserve size \ufffd Small \ufffd Large\n\nOwnership \ufffd Clear \ufffd Viewed as \u201cpublic property\u201d\n\ufffd Public accessibility and right to use\n\nBoundary management \ufffd Relatively easy \ufffd Hard (even impossible) to control\nactivities on the boundary\n\n\ufffd Hard enforcement\n\nSeasonal protection \ufffd Relatively low \ufffd Relative high\n\ufffd Need seasonal full protection during the year\n\n(fishing propagation grounds)\n\nSpecies move out after propagation \ufffd Less \ufffd More\n\nConnectivity \ufffd Relatively low \ufffd Relatively high\n\nPredictability \ufffd Relatively high \ufffd Relatively low\n\nSensitivity \ufffd Relatively low \ufffd Relatively high\n\nData collection \ufffd Relatively easy \ufffd Relatively hard\n\nS.-Y.

Study area\n\nLocated off the northeast of Taiwan, Gueishan Island and its\nsurrounding waters are a potential site for establishing MPAs, as\nproposed in the Ocean Policy White Paper. Gueishan Island is\napproximately 10 km from Taiwan's coast, and the highest point\non the island is 398 m above sea level (Fig. 1). Because no specific\nmethods and criteria exist that define and calculate the coverage\narea of MPAs in Taiwan, it is critical to set a physical study\nboundary to estimate the covered area of the MPAs in Taiwan's\nterritorial waters [10]. Based on considering both the adminis-\ntrative boundary and border of various stakeholders, the study\narea includes Gueishan Island and its surrounding waters accord-\ning to the Toucheng Township fishing rights and the delineation of\nterritorial waters in Taiwan.

Therefore, the northern and southern boundaries\nof the study area are extensions of the fishing rights area (north\nfrom the SanDiaoJiao and south to the Lanyang Estuary), and the\neastern boundary extends 12 nautical miles from the baseline\n(Fig. 1). The study area covers approximately 732 km\u201d, including\nthe territorial waters, inner waters, and Gueishan Island, and its\nmaximum depth is approximately 800 m.\n\nThe Kuroshio current and diverse geographical features along\nthe east coast of Taiwan provide abundant fisheries resources in\nproximity to Gueishan Island. From an economic perspective, the\nstudy site is one of the major fishing grounds in Taiwan, and\nvarious highly economically valuable fishery species inhabit this\narea for feeding, spawning, or migrating along the current. The\nabundant food resources and geographic location between the\ncontinental shelf and slope also attracts whales and dolphins.\n\n\n\n\nGueishan Island has recently become a famous tourist attraction\nfor whale watchers. In addition, rare hydrothermal vents are\nlocated at the southeastern end of Gueishan Island. The scale\nand number of hydrothermal vents comprises one of the world's\nlargest hydrothermal vent systems [11]. The hydrothermal vent\ncrab Xenograpsus testudinatus, an endemic species with a unique\nlifestyle and chemolithotrophic food web has not been observed in\nany other hydrothermal vent ecosystem [12]. This discussion\nshows the distinguishing characteristics and complexity of estab-\nlishing an MPA around Gueishan Island.\n\nThe enhancement of fishing technologies and the development\nof marine tourism has affected the catchment area [13], and the\nbehavioral patterns of whales and dolphins has also been influ-\nenced [14]. To minimize the degradation of marine resources,\nresearchers and the government have been advocating the\nGueishan Island MPA, and certain local communities have\nexpressed their willingness to cooperate with the MPA concept\n[15]. However, the agreement to establish the MPAs is conceptual.\nConsequently, because the proposed Gueishan Island MPA involves\nnumerous stakeholders and protection objectives, a long debate is\nanticipated concerning the boundary delineation, size, regulation,\nand limitations of the MPAs. Few studies have researched the MPA\nzoning strategies according to various interests in Taiwan. In an\neffort to maintain sustainability and minimize conflicts, this study\naddresses critical issues concerning Gueishan Island and proposes\npotentially suitable zoning strategies.\n\n3. Analytical framework and methods\n\n3.1. Protection objections and strategies\n\nBased on the perspective purported by the International Union\nfor Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the goal of establishing MPAs is\nto conserve biological diversity and productivity [6]. Both of these\n\nprospects are viewed as equally crucial to maintaining the health\nof the ocean environment and ensure the economic stability of\naffected communities. To achieve this goal, specific, tangible, and\nconcrete objectives must be established, although these objectives\nmight be internally conflicting. For example, the expectation of\nhigh productivity might be incompatible with the size of the no-\ntake zone. Therefore, before commencing the MPA selection\nprocess, defining clear objectives and understanding the potential\nrelations among stakeholders is the first and one of the most\ncritical steps [16]. The importance of the proposed Gueishan Island\nMPA can be detailed from various perspectives. After comparing\ncase studies, reviewing extant literature, and conducting in-depth\ninterviews with various stakeholders such as experts, local author-\nity officials, local communities, and fishermen's associations, a\nmultiple criteria structure based on each objective is introduced\nand applied for the subsequent spatial analysis (Fig. 2). Three\nmajor objectives, detailed as follows, are selected in this study to\ncompliment the MPA guidelines discussed by the IUCN [16].\n\n3.1.1. Objective to protect unique ecosystems\nThis objective is aimed at protecting the critical biogeographical\n\nfeatures that have unique and representative characteristics. Several\nprevious studies have asserted that hydrothermal vents possess key\nfeatures that provide biogeographic, ecological, scientific, and social\nvalue [11,12]. Because there are numerous unknowns factors asso-\nciated with the hydrothermal vent ecosystem, and because the water\nbody has distinctive properties, such as high temperatures (45\u201360 1C)\nand acidity (1.75\u20134.6 pH) [17], the protection strategy and criteria\nshould focus on protecting the core area by maintaining a buffer zone\nthat ensures minimal disturbance.\n\n3.1.2. Objective of productivity\nEffective sustainable fishing practices must balance local eco-\n\nnomic needs and ecological system resilience. Therefore, an EBM\n\nFig. 1. Location of Gueishan Island and study area.\n\nS.-Y. Lu et al. / Marine Policy 48 (2014) 21\u201329 23\n\n\n\napproach is suitable for protecting the nursery grounds, providing\nstable food sources, and maintaining an abundance of plankton,\nlarvae, and other highly valued species. To delineate the acceptable\nlocation and size of the no-take zone and minimize the conflict\nand competition among fishermen, this objective requires regular\nnegotiation among planners, decision-makers, and stakeholders.\n\n3.1.3. Objective to protect target species\nIn addition to the unique hydrothermal vent ecosystem and\n\ncritical ecosystem-supporting productivity (e.g., juvenile, feeding,\nbreeding, or rest areas), this objective aims to support critical\necological values on a regional scale. Whales and dolphins have\nbeen identified as key species in this region; accordingly, their\nmigratory route and the surrounding habitat must be considered\nas an integrated ecosystem that is associated with other protected\nareas in proximity to the Festoon Islands. Therefore, simulta-\nneously maximizing the connectivity of migratory routes while\nminimizing the impact of recent blossoming marine activities (e.g.,\nwhale watching) should form the basis of the protection strategy\nand principle for this objective.\n\n3.2. Data analysis tools\n\nDelineating MPAs requires a substantial volume of basic data.\nWhen the initial protection objectives comprise multiple criteria,\nan increasingly large data volume is required to assist in making\ndecisions. Unfortunately, data collection and monitoring in marine\nenvironments is difficult, which affects many MPA authorities\nworldwide. Socioeconomic data from local and expert systems\nprovide substantial assistance for data-poor regions [18]. Because\nit is difficult to obtain all of the required data for the Gueishan\nIsland region, this research compiled related literature, the Ocean\nData Bank (ODB) in Taiwan, and in-depth interviews with local\n\nassociations and experts. Table 2 shows the data used in this study.\nThe observation data of whales and dolphins was collected from a\nlocal professional whale-watching fleet.\n\nTo provide protection of critical species and separate conflicts\namong stakeholders, developing an effective zoning plan to\nestablish MPAs is a critical step. However, it is difficult to define\nboundaries for the protection of a marine environment. With the\ndevelopment of technology, increasing numbers of tools and\nmethodologies have become available that assist in analyzing\nspatial data for decision-making processes and applications.\nMARXAN software was developed to map the Great Barrier Reef\nin Australia [19]. The Gwaii Haanas National MPA applied Ecopath\nwith Ecosim to model and simulate the critical areas for protection\n[20], and ArcGISs was employed to develop a marine planning\nframework in South Australia [21]. These tools facilitate the\nvisualization and clarification of complex spatial information for\nthe general public and decision-makers, and the zoning process\nfor planners. In addition, the practice of spatial analysis can assist\nin visualizing and examining the relationships among various\nusages and stakeholders in a single marine space [2]. In this study,\nthe functions of 3D spatial analysis and statistics are integrated\ninto a geographic information system (GIS) that considers time\nfactors to define the proposed Gueishan Island MPA. AcGIS 10 was\ncombined with several relevant functions in the MolderBuilder\napplication.\n\n3.3. Spatial multi-criteria analysis\n\nThe protection of 20% of the water territories around Gueishan\nIsland is the primary objective of this study. Because multiple\nprotection objectives are identified in this study, the zoning plan\ncan vary based on different scenarios. Table 3 shows the zoning\ncriteria based on each protection objective listed in Fig. 2.

If more than one\ncriterion is selected, the largest or combined coverage should be\nset as the core protection area based on the precautionary\nprinciple. Various alternatives are anticipated based on different\ncombinations of the core and buffer areas. For example, inside the\n\n20% protected water territory, 5% of the area could be a protection\nzone for the hydrothermal vent, 9% for fisheries resources, and 6%\nfor the cetacean protection. The various alternative scenarios are\nbased on the priorities of protection objectives, policy orientation\nand scenario setup.

If more than one\ncriterion is selected, the largest or combined coverage should be\nset as the core protection area based on the precautionary\nprinciple. Various alternatives are anticipated based on different\ncombinations of the core and buffer areas. For example, inside the\n\n20% protected water territory, 5% of the area could be a protection\nzone for the hydrothermal vent, 9% for fisheries resources, and 6%\nfor the cetacean protection. The various alternative scenarios are\nbased on the priorities of protection objectives, policy orientation\nand scenario setup. One scenario can be the maximum protection\n\n\n\n\non fisheries resources, and another scenario can be the maximum\nprotection on cetacean species. This methodology of multiple\ncriteria can help decision-makers to better understand the differ-\nent scenarios, protected zones and potential impact.\n\nFor this study, in-depth interview is used to elucidate the issues\nassociated with the proposed Gueishan Island MPA and the priorities\nof zoning alternatives. The interviewees were requested to review the\nproposed protection objectives, zoning criteria, alternatives, and to\nprovide their opinions on the zoning plan, recommended scenarios,\nmanagement strategies, and implementation of the proposed MPA.\nThe interviewees included MPA experts, local authorities in fisheries\nmanagement, local non-government organizations, and members of\nfishermen's associations.\n\n4. Results and zoning plan\n\n4.1. Selection of priorities\n\nPrevious studies have shown that many MPAs have achieved\ntheir ecological goals after implementing their corresponding\nzoning plans, although they are typically confronted with manage-\nrial difficulties and conflicts. To ensure the efficient management\nof the MPAs the planning and zoning process includes interviews,\ndiscussions with stakeholders, and the acquisition of local knowl-\nedge. Several previous studies have asserted that the stakeholders'\n\ninvolvement is a key factor for the successful implementation of\nMPAs [26,27]. Other research has considered the perspectives of\nlocal fishermen as an index for the social acceptance of MPAs, and\nas tools for performance monitoring [28]. The involvement of\nstakeholders can be set in various stages of the research (Fig. 3).\nThe majority of the interviewees agreed at an early stage to set\nseveral smaller protected zones based on existing laws instead of a\nsingle large protected zone. The key species, critical principles,\nzoning criteria, and the selection of alternative scenarios are based\non extant literature and the in-depth interviews.\n\n4.2. Zoning plan\n\nThe zoning plans for the Gueishan Island MPA can be proposed\nfollowing (a) the spatial multi-criteria analysis, (b) defining the\nalternatives to the core protection and buffer areas, and\n(c) conducting in-depth interviews to establish the priorities\nselection. The percentage of the protected zone within the study\narea and the delineation differ based on the criteria of various\nscenarios. Fig. 4 and Table 4 show various alternatives, determined\nby examining the following scenarios: (a) minimum protection on\nthese three resources (16.9%); (b) maximum protection on cetacean\nresources (25.9%); (c) maximum protection on fisheries resources\n(27.4%); and (d) maximum protection on all three resources\ncombined (36.7%). The zoning model is set in the GIS, which assists\nin altering the parameters of the defined protection priorities. The\nvisualization tool assists in enhancing communications among the\n\nFig. 4. Alternative scenarios for proposed Gueishan Island MPA.\n\nS.-Y. Lu et al. / Marine Policy 48 (2014) 21\u20132926\n\n\n\nvarious stakeholders in the subsequent phase of the setup of MPA,\nsuch as the implementation stage. Previous research has stated\nthat because the shape of the protected areas could affect the\nimplementation and management of the MPA, a linear site bound-\nary with coordinates of turning points is substantially more\neffective and simpler to manage [29]. Therefore, the shapes and\nareas of the discussed scenarios are altered based on the tangent\nline (Fig. 5), and the protected areas are greater than 20% in all of\nthese scenarios (Table 5).\n\n4.3. Enforcement\n\nThe majority of the stakeholders in this area agreed that the\nzoning plan should compliment relevant regulations. Any protected\nareas that lack effective management and enforcement are suscep-\ntible to failure. In the long term, Gueishan Island and the surrounding\nocean should establish an MPA that is managed by one authority\nonly. The recommended management zones, permitted activities,\ninvolved stakeholders, and related regulations in this study should be\n\nTable 4\nAlternative scenarios for proposed Gueishan Island MPA.\n\nProtected area Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\nMin. protection on three\nobjectives\n\nMax. protection on cetacean\nresources\n\nMax. protection on fisheries\nresources\n\nMax. protection on three\nobjectives\n\nZone of hydrothermal vent\nprotection\n\n4000 m buffer from the\nvents\u00bc52.56 km2\n\n5500 m buffer from the\nvents\u00bc98.18 km2\n\n5500 m buffer from the\nvents\u00bc98.18 km2\n\n5500 m buffer from the\nvents\u00bc98.18 km2\n\nZone of cetacean protection 10% coverage of the densest\ndistribution for cetacean\npopulation\u00bc34.64 km2\n\n20% coverage of the densest\ndistribution for cetacean\npopulation\u00bc69.69 km2\n\n10% coverage of the densest\ndistribution for cetacean\npopulation\u00bc34.64 km2\n\n10% coverage of the densest\ndistribution for cetacean\npopulation\u00bc34.64 km2\n\nZone of fisheries protection 5% coverage of richness of\nplankton, larval resources\n\u00bc36.38 km2\n\n5% coverage of richness of\nplankton, larval resources\n\u00bc36.38 km2\n\n10% coverage of richness of\nplankton, larval resources\n\u00bc72.90 km2\n\n20% coverage of richness of\nplankton, larval resources\n\u00bc145.84 km2\n\nTotal protected area 123.51 km2 189.70 km2 200.44 km2 268.38 km2\n\nPercentage of protected\narea inside the site\n\n16.9% 25.9% 27.4% 36.7%\n\nFig. 5.

During the zoning\nprocess, it is anticipated that several zones based on various protec-\ntion objectives overlap. To minimize any controversy in management\nand enforcement, a clear priority must be established (Table 7).\n\n5. Conclusion and future development\n\nThe zoning of MPAs is a global activity aimed at reducing the\nimpact of human development on the marine environment. The\ngoal for establishing MPAs is to maintain biodiversity and to\nachieve sustainable development in the marine environment.\nAccording to the in-depth interviews and extant literature, the\nmajority of stakeholders and local communities related to\nGueishan Island agreed with the goals and concepts of establishing\nMPAs, although the physical zoning plan could be problematized\nby conflicts among the various protection objectives and usages.\nQuantity and quality methodologies, spatial multi-criteria analysis,\ngeographic information systems, and in-depth interviews are\nemployed in this study to delineate the boundaries and various\nzones for the proposed Gueishan Island MPA. Several conclusions\nand suggestions for future development are detailed as follows.\n\nPlanning for MPAs must address contradictory values from top-\ndown and bottom-up perspectives. Defining the goals, objectives,\nand related zoning strategies requires top-down policy guidance,\nalthough the MPAs could fail if there is insufficient local involve-\nment throughout the planning to implementation process. This\nstudy applied both top-down and bottom-up strategies through-\nout the planning process. The goals, protection objectives, and\nalternatives were generated based on policies, extant literature,\nand case studies; however, neither the decision-makers nor the\nplanners can or should decide on the selection priority for the\nalternatives and subsequent enforcement. During the in-depth\ninterviews, any alternatives and zoning plans can be modified to\nsuit actual events and minimize any conflicts. Throughout the\ndiscussion and interview process, visualization proved to be a\nuseful tool for facilitating communication. Because it is difficult to\nidentify landmarks or signs in a marine environment, fishermen\nand local communities are typically unaware of the proposed MPA\nboundaries. This compounds the challenges and uncertainties\nduring the negotiation process. Visualization technologies such\nas ArcGIS, simulated photo images, and videos can improve the\nunderstanding of stakeholders, thereby facilitating effective\ndecision-making.\n\nTable 5\nAlternative scenarios with linear site boundary for proposed Gueishan Island MPA.\n\nProtected area Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\nMax. protection on\nhydrothermal vent\n\nMax. protection on cetacean\nresources\n\nMax. protection on fisheries\nresources\n\nMax. protection on three\nobjectives\n\nTotal protected area 148.99 km2 228.25 km2 235.58 km2 315.16 km2\n\nPercentage of protected area inside\nthe site\n\n20.3% 31.2% 32.2% 43.0%\n\nTable 6\nRecommended enforcement in each management zone.\n\nHydrothermal vent protection zone Cetacean protection zone Fisheries resources protection zone\n\nType of Protection based on IUCN\nclassification\n\nIa Strict Nature Reserve IV Habitat/species management area VI Protected area with sustainable\nuse of natural resources\n\nMajor concern in zoning The area affected from hot spring\nmay vary with current and season. It\nis critical to monitor the water\ntemperature, marine physical,\nchemistry data to ensure the\nhydrothermal eco-system is fully\nprotected.\n\nWhales and dolphins can migrate\nthrough current, season, and even\ndifferent time period in a single day.\nIt is critical to protect not only the\ndensest area for cetacean from\nobservation record, but also set strict\nregulations for whale-watching\nactivities.\n\nFishing resources are sensitive to\nseasonal changes. The spawning\nand breeding seasons need strict\nprotection. The seasonal protection\nzone can be set to protect\nresources, and keep sustainable\nusage for fishermen.\n\nConflicts among stakeholders Conflicts may occur between tourism\nand conservation.\n\nConflicts may occur among tourism,\nfishing and conservation.\n\nConflicts may occur between\nfishing and conservation.\n\nLaws and regulations in short term Cultural Heritage Conservation Law Wildlife Conservation Law Fisheries Act\n\nTable 7\nIllustrates the zones with overlapping, and the priority to follow.\n\nFor the Zones on Top Hydrothermal vent\nprotection zone\n\nCetacean\nprotection zone\n\nFisheries resources\nprotection zone\u25cf: Entire Overlay\n\n\u25ef: Partial Overlay\nNo Mark: No Overlay Core Buffer Core Buffer No-Take Core Buffer\n\nHydrothermal vent protection zone Core\nBuffer \u25ef \u25ef \u25ef \u25ef\n\nCetacean protection zone Core \u25ef\nBuffer \u25ef\n\nFisheries resources protection zone No-Take Core\nBuffer \u25ef\n\nCurrent regulations under Fisheries Act No-Take on Fish Larvala \u25cf \u25ef \u25ef \u25ef\nLimitation on Trawlb \u25cf \u25ef \u25ef \u25ef \u25ef\n\na The 500 m near shore is the no-take zone on fish larval during June to August each year under the current Fisheries Act.\nb The 3 nautical miles from shore is limited on trawling based on the current Fisheries Act.\n\nS.-Y. Lu et al. / Marine Policy 48 (2014) 21\u20132928\n\n\n\nAn integrated and well-managed ocean database that includes\ndata for the physical, environmental, biological, and catchment is a\ncritical element for the effective planning of MPAs. An analysis\nbased on scientific information can assist in minimizing mistakes,\nand in convincing people with differing opinions. Therefore, it is\ncrucial to develop an ocean database in Taiwan. Because there are\nconsiderable differences between marine and terrestrial protec-\ntion systems, four-dimensional information is critical in planning\nMPAs. For example, information on water depth and current\nbehavior is crucial for fisheries resource management. Varying\nwater depths might contain dissimilar fish species and economic\nvalues, and information on ocean currents would be useful in\nsimulating and evaluating the movement of plankton, shoals of\nfish, nursery grounds, spawning grounds, and other vital habitats.\n\nThere are no specific laws and regulations related directly to\nMPAs in Taiwan. Therefore, the multiple protection targets require\nsuitable laws for further implementation. In the short term, the\nCultural Heritage Conservation Law is recommended for addres-\nsing hydrothermal vent protection, the Wildlife Conservation Law\ncan be applied for cetacean protection, and the Fisheries Act is\nsuitable for fisheries resource protection. To ensure long term\neffectiveness, there is an urgent need for the promulgation of\nintegrated laws and regulations, as well as the establishment of\ncorresponding authorities. Planning and establishing a zoning plan\nfor MPAs is only the first step of a lengthy process. Management\nand enforcement will play critical roles in the subsequent phases.\nThe model of management and local participation in various\nprotection objectives requires further study in the near future.\n\nBecause of the high connectivity and complexity of marine\nenvironments, the traditional, single protection-oriented metho-\ndology is unsuitable for the proposed Gueishan Island MPA plan.\nThis study is an initial study in spatial multi-criteria analysis to\nfacilitate the implementation of an MPA in Taiwan, and provides a\nframework that considers both top-down and bottom-up strate-\ngies. The framework was examined in a small area, and further\nstudies should focus on the connections among MPAs to facilitate\nthe establishment of an MPA network in Taiwan.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported financially by the National Science\nCouncil (NSC) of Taiwan (Contract numbers 98-2621-M-019-003-\nand 99-2621-M-019-002-).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Hassan R, Scholes R, Neville A.
