In equilibrium, a bind-\ning labor-market constraint interacts with the youth bulge in determining the level of insur-\nrection activities within the society. We test the implications of our model on a sample \nof 135 non-OECD countries in the post-Cold War period and find the effect of the youth \ncohort’s relative size on conflict onsets to be moderated by changes in the labor-market \nconditions as measured by unemployment rates. Generally, the results provide evidence \nthat the underlying institutional setting shapes the conflict potential inherent in a given \ndemographic structure.\n\nKeywords Youth bulges · Demography · Insurrections · Political economy of revolutions\n\nJEL Classification H56 · J10 · J22 · P16\n\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s1112 \n7-018-0514-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n * Thomas Apolte \n apolte@wwu.de\n\n Lena Gerling \n lena.gerling@uni-muenster.de\n\n1 Center for Interdisciplinary Economics, University of Münster, Scharnhorststrasse 100, \n48151 Münster, Germany\n\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-3543-6694\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1007/s11127-018-0514-8&domain=pdf\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-018-0514-8\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-018-0514-8\n\n\n64 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWhen watching news reports about insurrection activities, riots, demonstrations or terrorist \nincidents, one is hardly ever surprised to see that most activists are young, and whenever \nviolence is associated with these activities, it is also no surprise that most activists are \nmale. Hence, it appears obvious that Goldstone (2002) claims that historical periods of \npolitical violence are always closely related to periods of demographically young socie-\nties. Nevertheless, a large youth cohort in the population has come under somewhat closer \ninspection in the social sciences only recently. Since Graham Fuller first used the term \n“youth bulge” in 1995 in a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conference report (Fuller \n1995; see also Fuller 2003; Niang 2010, p. 8) to pinpoint a potential demographic source \nof conflict, the term has been picked up by news media (Caldwell 2007; Heinsohn 2007, \n2009; Whelton 2007), and, somewhat hesitantly, also by scholarly researchers (Mesquida \nand Wiener 1999; Goldstone 2002; Urdal 2006; Niang 2010; Schomaker 2013).\n\nEven so, it was no earlier than 2006 when researchers first published a systematic \nempirical investigation of how the demographics of a youth bulge affect political violence \n(Urdal 2006; see also Urdal 2004). Moreover, until then, sophisticated speculation rather \nthan scholarly analyses dominated the search for theoretical answers to the question of if \nand how youth bulges cause political conflict. While many, if not most, of these sophisti-\ncated speculations have included some economic reasoning, no consistent theory has yet \nbeen provided that captures the main ideas, systematically relates them and offers testable \nempirical implications. In particular, no theory has been proposed explaining why young \npeople in a youth-bulge situation are particularly prone to political violence in general and \nto insurrection activities in particular.\n\nWhen it comes to political violence, it makes sense to distinguish spontaneous out-\nbreaks from deliberate insurrection activities. In this paper we are interested in the latter, \nand we generally will refer to these types of events as “insurrection activities”. Since insur-\nrection activities are defined here as collective action toward a certain, and at least alleg-\nedly common, goal, a theory that explains youth bulges and insurrections needs to show \nin a consistent manner how the existence of a youth bulge facilitates an insurgent group \nto become effective in achieving the (alleged) common goal. This is how we aim to add to \nthe literature. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates the most important \ncharacteristics of youth bulges into a theory of insurrection activities, and then we test its \npredictions with empirical evidence.\n\nIn practice, grievances against a ruling elite typically relate to the distribution of wealth, \nof political power, or both. That is why we construct our theory around a model of a soci-\nety that is dominated by a kleptocratic political and economic elite. Yet, this assumption \nis not necessarily consistent with reality, and our empirical work is not restricted to those \ntypes of societies. Rather, for the proposed mechanism to work it suffices that the youth \ncohort members perceive the government as being unjust in some sense. On this basis, we \nintroduce a demographic factor that represents the youth bulge, as well as three hypoth-\nesized characteristics of relatively young persons, namely a risk-seeking attitude, a low \npotential to contribute to the traditional labor market, and a high potential to contribute to \nan “insurrection market”.\n\nThe main implication of our theoretical model is that labor-market restrictions inter-\nact with the youth cohort’s relative size in determining the aggregate level of insurrection \nactivities within the society. We show that a rise in the youth-bulge ratio changes the ratio \nof marginal utilities derived from regular work, on the one hand, and insurrection activities \n\n\n\n65Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\non the other. Yet, whether or not the resulting conflict potential actually translates into \noutbreaks of political violence depends on the presence of (institutional) constraints that \nrestrict the youth cohort’s members’ access to the regular labor market. In brief, if labor-\nmarket regulations limit young individuals from exploiting economic opportunities in the \nofficial economy, those individuals may more easily be hired by revolutionary entrepre-\nneurs even if marginal utility from insurrections falls short of the wage rate in the regular \nlabor market.\n\nThe second part of the paper presents an empirical investigation of the central hypoth-\nesis derived from our theoretical model, namely the interaction effect of youth bulges and \nlabor-market restrictions on the incidence of violent conflicts. We test this link with a panel \nof 135 non-OECD countries over the 1992–2012 period, approximating labor-market \nrestrictions by changes in unemployment. Additionally, we exploit plausibly exogenous \nvariation in youth bulges by measuring the size of the youth cohort at the time when its \nmembers where born. We find a positive and significant interaction between youth bulges \nand unemployment that is robust to various alternative specifications.\n\nOur empirical analysis adds to the literature on the determinants of civil conflicts \n(Fearon and Laitin 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Blattman and Miguel 2010). Even \nthough the literature offers reasons for why large youth cohorts result in institutional bot-\ntlenecks, there is, at least to our knowledge, no study that systematically integrates labor-\nmarket indicators in an empirical framework aimed at testing the demography-insurrection \nnexus. Thus, our paper also aims to contribute to the evidence of the link between youth \nbulges and civil conflicts by proposing an important institutional transmission channel that \nmoderates the effect of demographic pressures on the society’s potential for conflict (Urdal \n2006; Collier et al. 2009; Campante and Chor 2012).\n\nIn the following section, we briefly clarify some fundamental definitions and concepts \nand we relate them to the existing literature. Based on this groundwork, we develop our \ntheoretical model in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we examine empirically our central theoretical con-\nclusions in a broad cross-country panel dataset. In Sect. 5, we discuss the implications of \nour results, suggest further empirical and theoretical research and conclude.\n\n2  Some basic concepts and definitions\n\nA youth bulge represents, at the very least, an historical demographic event during which \na country starts to transition toward a modern society. At a certain point in time, both the \ndropping of mortality rates and the rising of per-capita incomes tend to drive birth rates \ndown, which leads to a long population tail of adult and older people, on the one hand, and \nto smaller sizes of succeeding children cohorts on the other, so that a given youth cohort \ntends to create a “bulge” in the overall age structure of the society on its way toward mod-\nernization. Over time, this bulge works itself all the way through the age structure until it \neventually disappears. Viewed that way, it makes sense to follow (Urdal 2004, 2006) by \nmeasuring a youth bulge as the youth cohort size relative to the total working-age popula-\ntion. Hence, the relative youth cohort size (RYCS) is what we refer to in the rest of this \npaper when describing the size of a youth bulge.\n\nA youth bulge may have its merits, as it can, for example, be associated with Samuel-\nson’s (1958) biological interest rate. Hence, relatively low per-capita contributions from \nthe youth cohort to common-pool consumption transfer systems like social security are \n\n\n\n66 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nassociated with relatively high per-capita benefits to older cohorts, which lead to particu-\nlarly wealthy pensioner cohorts in some industrialized countries.\n\nHowever, for members of the youth-bulge cohort themselves, these advantages hardly \never materialize. To the contrary, a demographic bulge implies a relative abundance of the \nrespective cohort’s members, starting from birth throughout the cohort members’ lives. At \nthe time when the “bulge” cohort members approach adulthood, they potentially face bot-\ntlenecks (Urdal 2006, p. 615) in search for opportunities in education and in job markets. \nDepending on the characteristics of the economic and political institutions, these bottle-\nnecks tentatively lead to either real-wage drops or underemployment as well as to a gen-\neral lack of career opportunities (Easterlin 1987).1 Furthermore, as the youth cohort starts \nbecoming competitive on job markets and in politics, the older cohorts might be inclined \nto limit the youth cohort’s access to income-earning positions and possibly to political \nparticipation as well. Depending on the institutional background, youth cohorts may har-\nbor grievances against the society that is keeping them down, which might, once again, \ndepending on the underlying institutional setting, turn out to help fuel political violence \n(Niang 2010, p. 12).\n\nTo put it in economic terms: The bottleneck hypothesis of a youth bulge implies that \nthe abundant youth cohort faces dropping relative prices for whatever its members contrib-\nute to society. Yet, the resulting economic and political effects (while manifold) obviously \ndepend on numerous factors within the society’s politico-institutional setting. A flexible, \nmarket-oriented setting that does not privilege incumbents holding both political and eco-\nnomic positions would experience different consequences from a youth bulge than would \na society that systematically privileges those who already have been successful in occupy-\ning such positions in the past. As a result, if young potential successors to political and \neconomic positions face open markets, but falling supply prices, they may still find that \ntrying to fill traditional opportunities is more advantageous than engaging in insurrection \nactivities.\n\nThat scenario changes when a relatively abundant youth cohort faces “closed shops”, \nwhereby members of older cohorts occupy both economic and political positions and \ndefend those positions using administrative means. In such a case, members of the youth \ncohort may not be able to break into the sphere of these privileges, even if they work \nhard, offer better ideas and provide better services. Currently, the most dramatic exam-\nple of demographic pressures interacting with institutional restrictions might explain the \nhigh conflict propensity of the Middle East. Figure 5 in the “Appendix” illustrates the rela-\ntionship between poor labor-market conditions and youth bulges in Middle Eastern and \nNorth African (MENA) countries. The plot shows that most countries with some type of \ninternal conflict, like Tunisia, Syria or Yemen, experienced either high levels of unem-\nployment, large youth bulges or both. Even though the conflict in the Middle East is an \nadmittedly vastly complex phenomenon in which historical, constitutional, religious and, \nindeed, demographic aspects interact in myriad ways that cannot be captured by simple \ncorrelations, the anecdotal evidence nevertheless indicates the we need a better understand-\ning of how the politico-economic setting shapes the conflict potential inherent in a certain \ndemographic structure. In fact, the existence of a large well-educated youth cohort in com-\nbination with poor labor-market prospects and repressive autocratic institutions has been \n\n1 These effects already have been mentioned by Goldstone (1991, p. 139): “If real wages are above average, \nthen ...a youthful population can be stabilizing. However, if there is a precipitous drop in real wages, then \n...the youthfulness of the population can increase the mobilization potential of the population”.\n\n\n\n67Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\ndiscussed in the literature as one of the central explanations of the recent phase of political \ninstability in many MENA countries (Austin 2011; Campante and Chor 2012).\n\nStill, while the grievances arising from poor labor-market conditions may be a necessary \ncondition for the youth cohort to engage in insurrection activities, it is not a sufficient con-\ndition by itself, because of the collective-action problem of revolutions (Olson 1965/1971; \nTullock 1971, 1974; Lichbach 1995; Kurrild-Klitgaard 2003). Hence, while spontaneous \npolitical demonstrations and even violent riots might be explained by the development of a \nyouth bulge in a closed-shop society alone (Kuran 1989), deliberate insurrection activities \ncall for more than just that, namely for a more comprehensive approach to the problem. For \nthis reason, we embed our ideas in a dual labor-market model (Grossman 1991, 1999; Wall \n2006). Note, however, that we do not aim to explain collective action as such. Rather, we \naim to determine the conditions under which youth-bulge societies are more susceptible to \npolitical violence than others, and our central hypothesis rests on the allocation of time by \nyoung individuals when institutional restrictions are present.2\n\nIn order to incorporate these ideas within a theoretical model, we assume a society that \nis characterized by a particularly privileged politico-economic elite that controls both the \npolitical and the economic spheres of action. While markets are relied on to a certain extent \nto coordinate economic activities, all productive assets are owned and operated by mem-\nbers of this particular elite. It is then hypothesized that such an underlying institutional \nsetting may induce potential political entrepreneurs to enter the market for economic and \npolitical power by way of forming insurrection groups. While these entrepreneurs pro-\nvide solutions for the collective-action problem underlying insurrection activities, they are \ndriven solely by their own personal interests, that is, a desire to redistribute power and \nwealth away from the incumbent elites to themselves. In doing so, they hire young poten-\ntial insurrection activists; this is where the effects of the youth bulge come into play.\n\n3  An economic model of insurrections and the youth bulge\n\n3.1  Basic model\n\nConsider a society consisting of a ruling elite, which we refer to as the government elite G \nor simply the government, a competing elite, which we refer to as the revolutionary elite \nR, and a group of citizens. Both elite groups consist of some leading individuals plus a \nrelatively narrow clientele. G not only runs the government, but also owns all of the shares \nin the economy’s productive assets. Hence, while the assets are in private hands, the pri-\nvate owners stem from group G, and all profits flow into its members’ pockets. Finally, the \ngovernment elite imposes labor-income taxes on the citizens, the revenue from which the \nmembers of the elite also use for their own consumption.\n\nThe revolutionary elite R seizes resources from the part of the economy that it has \nbrought informally under its control. It uses these resources for its own consumption as \nwell as for hiring insurgents, who are promised compensation for their activities on the \n\n2 There is by now a vast amount of literature following Acemoglu and Robinson (2000, 2001, 2006) that \nis based on the notion of collectively sustained revolution constraints (see, e.g., Dorsch and Maarek 2015; \nCervellati et al. 2014). However, this literature suffers from a number of drawbacks. In general, the litera-\nture on revolutions suppresses the micro-structure of collective action, so that it provides an ex-post ration-\nalization rather than a causal explanation of insurrection activities (Apolte 2012).\n\n\n\n68 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nbasis of a broadly understood wage rate w\nI\n , paid either in cash or in kind.3 Naturally, \n\nthough, the compensation promise cannot be enforced legally, which offers opportunities \nfor the revolutionary elite to renege (Gates 2002). We hence define a measure � ∈ [0, 1] of \nthe revolutionary elite’s credibility in that respect. Formally, � denotes the share of cases \nin which the revolutionary elite delivers on its compensation promise, so that the expected \ncompensation rate is �w\n\nI\n . Finally, N citizens are neither part of G nor of R.\n\nWhile governmental control over all economic activities rests formally with the gov-\nernment elite, that group has effective control only over those parts of the economy that \nare not under the informal control of the revolutionary elite. To be precise, we model the \nrespective control capacities of the government and the revolutionary elites as shares AG \nand AR of the total productive assets in the economy. We normalize the total value of pro-\nductive assets to unity, so that AG + AR = 1 . While the share AG is formally as well as \neffectively under the control of the government, the share AR is only formally under the \ncontrol of the government; it is effectively controlled by the revolutionaries.\n\nTwo income-generating activities are available to the citizens; one is to work in the \nregular labor force, and the other is insurrection. We normalize the time each individual \ncitizen devotes to the two income-generating activities to unity. Hence, we assume that citi-\nzens allocate a fraction l to labor and another fraction i to insurrection, such that the time \nat their disposal is l + i ⩽ 1 on the level of a representative individual, and L + I ⩽ N with \nL = lN and I = iN on the level of the society as a whole. As the full time portfolio of the \ncitizens is, in principle, devoted to either work or insurrection, any situation l + i < 1 would \nresult from some sort of involuntary unemployment.\n\nLabor time is supplied to a private firm that utilizes all assets A. The private firm is run \nby a management that is appointed by members of the government elite and that is itself \npart of that elite. Insurrection activities are supplied to the members of the revolutionary \nelite R.\n\nAt this point, we nest the youth bulge into our model, considering the following \nobservations:\n\n• Bhuller et al. (2014) demonstrates that employees at the age of the youth-bulge cohort \nare usually far from having reached the peak of their labor-earning potentials. We there-\nfore assume this cohort to have, on average, lower labor-market earnings than employ-\nees of older ages. We refer to this effect as the productivity effect.\n\n• Insurrection activities typically consist of a conglomeration of independent individual \nviolent attacks. Hence, each of these attacks tends to be associated with immediate \nfeedback to the respective perpetrator. As Defoe et al. (2015) demonstrates, adolescents \nof the approximate age of the youth-bulge cohort exhibit a remarkably higher propen-\nsity to risky behavior, and particularly so when immediate feedback to risky activities \nis available. These traits lead to significantly higher rates in morbidity and mortality \ndespite the notably good physical health of representatives of the age group at hand \n(Pharo et al. 2011). We hence assume members of the youth-bulge cohort to be more \nprone to get engaged in adventurous activities like insurrection. Moreover, we assume \nthem to be less risk-averse in light of the questionable credibility of the revolutionary \n\n3 Acemoglu (2006) and Dorsch and Maarek (2015) consider the scope of tax instruments and deadweight-\nlosses from such intervention into the economy. Since they are not critical for the point raised in this paper, \nwe abstract from these losses.\n\n\n\n69Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\nelite to fulfill their compensation promises. We refer to this effect as the risk-aversion \neffect.\n\n• Individuals who have grievances against the government may gain expressive utility by \nparticipating in insurrection markets, which would reduce the overall marginal disutility \nof “work” in that market (Hillman 2010; Wintrobe 2006, p. 178). Mainly based on Furn-\nham (2015, pp. 19–27), we assume expressive sources of utility to apply particularly to \nyoung people, as they tend to be somewhat more passionate in their judgments and atti-\ntudes toward governments and potential revolutionaries than adults. We refer to this as the \ngrievance effect.\n\nIn order to incorporate these effects into the structure of our model, we first define a youth-\nbulge ratio r ∈ (0, 1) . That ratio is the share of people who belong to the group of poten-\ntially economically active young men between 15 and 24 years of age to the total labor force. \nWe then combine the youth-bulge ratio with the above-mentioned three effects at the relevant \nplaces in the model.\n\nWe start with the private firm, which we assume to utilize all productive assets A as well \nas labor L as inputs so as to maximize profits under conditions of perfect competition. We \nassume a production function of the form F(Le,A) , with Le being the effective labor supply. \nThe production function is assumed to satisfy the Inada conditions in the two arguments Le \nand A. In order to capture the productivity effect of the youth bulge, we define effective labor \nsupply as Le = �r−1L , with � ∈ (0, 1) . The economy’s output Y is then:\n\nNext, we model AR as being linearly dependent on the total time I that the citizens allocate \nto insurrection activities:\n\nWe assume that the government taxes labor income at a nominal payroll tax of rate tG . \nHowever, as the government’s effective control over the economy is limited by the revo-\nlutionaries’ share in power, the government can tax only that part of labor income that is \ngenerated under its formal control. Since we assume a homogenous production technology, \nthe share AG in the assets controlled by the government is, at the same time, the share in \nboth employment and the share of the payroll that can be taxed. The government’s effective \nlabor-income tax rate is hence AGtG . As we focus our attention on the citizens’ allocation \nof time between labor and insurrection activities and in order to keep the analysis simple, \nwe assume the government’s decision on the tax rate tG to be exogenous. On top of the \nunequal distribution of property rights, the tax rate tG is an indicator of how harshly the \ngovernment oppresses the citizens. The income YG of the government’s elite thus is:\n\nwhere � are the profits of the firm, assumed to flow into the pockets of its owners who all \nare members of the governmental elite. Additionally, w\n\nL\n is the labor-market wage rate, and \n\nL is the total number of workers employed.\nThe revolutionary elite, in turn, “asks” the firm’s management for “contributions” based on \n\nthe share AR of capital that is under revolutionary control, at a rate of tR . The revolutionaries’ \nincomes can thus be written as:\n\n(1)Y = F(�r−1L,A).\n\n(2)A\nR = 𝛽I with 𝛽 > 0.\n\n(3)Y\nG = � + t\n\nG\nA\nG\nw\nL\nL,\n\n(4)Y\nR = t\n\nR\nA\nR − �w\n\nI\nI, with t\n\nR\n⩽ �RY ,\n\n\n\n70 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nwhere w\nI\n is the compensation rate for insurrection activities, and �R ∈ (0, 1) is an upper \n\nbound of what can maximally be taxed away from the capital owners’ income under the \npower of the revolutionary elite, determined by formal or, obviously more important, infor-\nmal institutions. The private firm’s profit � is:\n\nAn individual citizen’s utility is determined by an additively separable utility function \nU = U\n\nL\n+ U\n\nI\n that depends on effective net labor income as well as on the compensa-\n\ntions for insurrection activities. Net labor income adds one-to-one to total utility, so that \nU\n\nL\n= (1 − tGAG)l . By contrast, compensations for insurrection activities are subject to \n\ndecreasing marginal utility, determined in part by the relative youth bulge ratio r, which \nimplements the risk-aversion effect of the youth bulge. In order to also implement the \ngrievance effect, we introduce a variable � ∈ [0, 1] , which indicates the desire, if any, to \nexpress one’s discontent with the government: A value of � = 0 indicates perfect acquies-\ncence to the incumbent’s actions, while rising utility by expressing sympathy with the rev-\nolutionary elite successively raises the level of � to a maximum of � = 1 . As argued above, \nyoung citizens derive more utility from expressing criticism of the government. In order \nto keep things simple, we implement this feature of the model by assuming � = 0 for all \nindividuals except the members of the youth cohort. This assumption allows us to interact \n� with the youth-bulge ratio r in order to measure an average citizen’s attitude toward the \ngovernment by r� . That interaction variable captures the risk-aversion effect with its com-\nponent r and the grievance effect with its component � . We define U\n\nI\n= �((1 + w\n\nI\n)r� − 1)i \n\nas the expected utility of insurrection activities. Total utility U = U\nL\n+ U\n\nI\n is hence given \n\nby:\n\nNote that the utility from compensation for insurrection activities turns out to be zero when \n� = 0 or � = 0 , or both. That marks the limiting case wherein insurrection activities are \nnon-rewarding from the point of view of the citizens. For any 𝜌 > 0 , a positive � will be \nmagnified by rises in the youth-bulge ratio r. Note further that for r = � = � = 1 , the utility \nof compensations for insurrection activities is simply w\n\nI\n , which therefore maps one-to-one \n\ninto utility in precisely the same way that the net wage on the formal labor market does. \nThis situation reflects the limiting case of no risk aversion, full credibility of the revolu-\ntionary elite’s compensation promise, and a maximum degree of grievance against the gov-\nernment. From the point of view of the citizens, insurrection activities are then a perfect \nsubstitute for regular work.\n\nThe final element to be incorporated into our model is a simple labor-market imperfec-\ntion. In particular, we assume a restriction on the side of the labor suppliers in the form of \na probability � ∈ (0, 1) of being unemployed. Since each citizen’s time devoted to either \nwork or insurrection is normalized to unity, and since the only legal way of spending time \nfor income generation is to work on the regular labor market, the level of full employment \non that market is simply N. Our relevant labor-market restriction will hence be L ⩽ �N . \nOn the individual citizen’s level, then, labor supply will be restricted by l ⩽ � . Within the \nframework described above, the firm, the revolutionary elite, and the citizens will maxi-\nmize their respective objective functions.4\n\n(5)� = F(�r−1L,A) − w\nL\nL.\n\n(6)U = (1 − A\nG\nt\nG)w\n\nL\nl + �((1 + w\n\nI\n)r� − 1)i.\n\n4 A detailed formal analysis of the following is provided in the “Appendix”.\n\n70 Public Choice (2018) 175:63-93\n\nwhere w, is the compensation rate for insurrection activities, and c*® € (0, 1) is an upper\nbound of what can maximally be taxed away from the capital owners’ income under the\npower of the revolutionary elite, determined by formal or, obviously more important, infor-\nmal institutions. The private firm’s profit z is:\n\na = F(6r7'L,A) — w_L. (5)\nAn individual citizen’s utility is determined by an additively separable utility function\nU=U,+U, that depends on effective net labor income as well as on the compensa-\ntions for insurrection activities. Net labor income adds one-to-one to total utility, so that\nU,, = (1 — 1°A®%)I. By contrast, compensations for insurrection activities are subject to\ndecreasing marginal utility, determined in part by the relative youth bulge ratio r, which\nimplements the risk-aversion effect of the youth bulge. In order to also implement the\ngrievance effect, we introduce a variable yw € [0,1], which indicates the desire, if any, to\nexpress one’s discontent with the government: A value of 4 = 0 indicates perfect acquies-\ncence to the incumbent’s actions, while rising utility by expressing sympathy with the rev-\nolutionary elite successively raises the level of 4 to a maximum of y = 1. As argued above,\nyoung citizens derive more utility from expressing criticism of the government. In order\nto keep things simple, we implement this feature of the model by assuming yp = 0 for all\nindividuals except the members of the youth cohort. This assumption allows us to interact\nu with the youth-bulge ratio r in order to measure an average citizen’s attitude toward the\ngovernment by ry. That interaction variable captures the risk-aversion effect with its com-\nponent r and the grievance effect with its component y. We define U, = p((1 + w,)™ — 1)i\nas the expected utility of insurrection activities. Total utility U = U, + U;, is hence given\nby:\nU =(1-A%r?)w,1 + p( +.) = Vi. (6)\nNote that the utility from compensation for insurrection activities turns out to be zero when\nu =0 or p=0, or both. That marks the limiting case wherein insurrection activities are\nnon-rewarding from the point of view of the citizens. For any p > 0, a positive y will be\nmagnified by rises in the youth-bulge ratio r. Note further that for r = p = wv = I, the utility\nof compensations for insurrection activities is simply w,, which therefore maps one-to-one\ninto utility in precisely the same way that the net wage on the formal labor market does.\nThis situation reflects the limiting case of no risk aversion, full credibility of the revolu-\ntionary elite’s compensation promise, and a maximum degree of grievance against the gov-\nernment. From the point of view of the citizens, insurrection activities are then a perfect\nsubstitute for regular work.\n\nThe final element to be incorporated into our model is a simple labor-market imperfec-\ntion. In particular, we assume a restriction on the side of the labor suppliers in the form of\na probability € € (0,1) of being unemployed. Since each citizen’s time devoted to either\nwork or insurrection is normalized to unity, and since the only legal way of spending time\nfor income generation is to work on the regular labor market, the level of full employment\non that market is simply N. Our relevant labor-market restriction will hence be L < eN.\nOn the individual citizen’s level, then, labor supply will be restricted by / < €. Within the\nframework described above, the firm, the revolutionary elite, and the citizens will maxi-\nmize their respective objective functions.*\n\n4 A detailed formal analysis of the following is provided in the “Appendix”.\n\na Springer\n\n\n\n\n71Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\nThe management of the firm takes F(�r−1L,A) and w\nL\n as given and maximizes net prof-\n\nits.

As these opportunity costs rise, insurrection activities will rise, too.\n\n4  Empirical evidence\n\nOur model has a number of empirical implications both in general and with respect to the \nyouth bulge. The general implications are:\n\n1. Productivity in the regular labor market, relative to the productivity of insurrection \nactivities, is a key factor for determining the allocation of time between regular work \nand insurrection activities. Consequently, a decline in either � or � , and an increase \nin tR� tend to raise insurgence activities at the aggregate level. Hence, it is not low \nproductivity or, for that matter, low wages and poverty as such, that drive people into \ninsurrection activities, but it is the ratio of utility between the two income-generating \nactivities, namely labor or insurrection, that counts. This is very much in line with now-\nestablished findings of the economic theory of terrorism, according to which terrorist \nactivists are by no means recruited from groups of people with low incomes and poor \neducations (Sageman 2004; Krueger 2008; Krieger and Meierrieks 2011).\n\n2. Unemployment is another key factor influencing the allocation of time between insur-\nrection activities and regular work. Tighter labor-market restrictions, as indicated by �2 , \nraise insurgence activities simply by restricting career options in the official labor market.\n\n3. The degree of oppression exercised by the government, as indicated by the government’s \neffective tax rate tGAG , lowers the opportunity costs of insurrection activities and, hence, \nraises their levels. Note that this effect materializes even for citizens with perfectly \nrational expectations regarding the production of the (perceived) public good associated \nwith insurrections. The reason is that oppression changes the opportunity costs of one \nactivity in terms of the other, and that changes the citizens’ optimal allocations of time.\n\nWith respect to the youth bulge, we have further implications. A rise in the youth-bulge \nratio tends to drive people away from the regular labor market into insurrection activities. \nThis follows from I�(r) > 0 in Eq. (9). Three main effects underlie that conclusion:\n\n(a) The youth-bulge ratio reduces the degree of risk aversion regarding the utility derived \nfrom insurrection activities. This follows from r� in Eq. (9).\n\n(b) The youth-bulge ratio changes the relationship between the utility derived from work, \non the one hand, and the utility derived from insurrection activities on the other. This \nis given by the first r in the denominator of (9).\n\n(c) Finally, the youth-bulge ratio interacts directly with the labor-market restriction, as can \nbe seen by the term r�2 in (9). Hence, a rise in the youth bulge, in combination with \npoor labor-market prospects, once again lowers the opportunity costs of insurrection \nactivities.\n\nThe labor-market restriction appears to be of particular importance. It suggests that it is not \nthe youth bulge itself that magnifies the threat of insurrection activities. It is rather the inter-\naction of a high percentage of the youth cohort (specifically, a high percentage of young \nmen) compared to the rest of the economically active population, with few labor-market \n\n\n\n74 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nopportunities that matters. Labor-market restrictions are reflected most directly by (invol-\nuntary) unemployment. Importantly however, our model’s prediction does not depend on \nthe specific source of the labor-market restriction. Although our policy implications focus \non institutional factors, shifts in the optimal time allocation are independent of this source, \nbe it cyclical or institutional. Hence, we should find that unemployment affects insurrection \nactivities independently of its source and this is what we test in the following analysis.\n\n4.1  Estimation strategy and data\n\nRather than applying a rigorous test of our theoretical model, we focus on the reduced-\nform estimation of one specific aspect of it, namely the interaction effect of youth bulges \nand labor-market restrictions on the outbreak of insurrections.8 The baseline specification \nof our empirical model is as follows:\n\nwhere i denotes countries and t denotes years. The dependent variable, I\ni,t , is a binary indi-\n\ncator that equals one when an insurrection onset is observed in a given country-year. The \nexplanatory variables of interest are the (1-year lagged) relative youth cohort size, denoted \nby RYCS\n\ni,t−1 , and the labor-market restriction (measured by changes in unemployment), \nwhich we denote by UE\n\ni,t−1 . Our main focus is on �3 , the coefficient of the interaction effect \nof RYCS\n\ni,t−1 and UE\ni,t−1 . The specification includes country fixed effects, �\n\ni\n , that control for \n\ntime-invariant differences across countries, and year fixed effects, �\nt\n , that control for com-\n\nmon shocks. In addition, we enter region-year fixed effects, �\nr,t , that account for regional \n\ndevelopments, such as the spread of new technologies (e.g., contraception). The vector \nX\n�\ni,t−1\n\n captures further time-varying controls that are included in some estimations, such as \npopulation and level of economic development. The disturbance term ( �\n\ni,t ) is allowed to be \nserially correlated and heteroscedastic.\n\nTo obtain data for insurrection activities, we rely on the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict \nDataset Version 4-2013 (Themnér and Wallensteen 2013). We focus on intrastate insurrec-\ntion events defined as a “contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or terri-\ntory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the govern-\nment of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths” (Gleditsch et al. 2002, p. 509). \nComparing different data sources such as the Archigos leader transition dataset (Goemans \net al. 2009) or Bank’s data on domestic conflicts (Banks and Wilson 2015), we believe that \nthe UCDP/PRIO conflict measures are theoretically most relevant as they focus on disputes \nbetween governments and rebellious groups that have at least some organizational struc-\nture. That definition reflects our model’s set-up of a revolutionary elite recruiting young \nactivists to conduct political violence. We consider both minor conflicts (25–999 battle-\nrelated deaths per year) and civil wars (with 1000 or more fatalities per year).\n\nSince countries often remain conflict prone after the occurrence of an insurrection \nevent, and ongoing insurrections are likely to have feedback effects on the demographic \nand economic characteristics of a country, we focus on the onset of a conflict period rather \n\n(10)\nProb (I\n\ni,t = 1) = �\ni\n+ �\n\nt\n+ �\n\nr,t + �1RYCSi,t−1 + �2UEi,t−1 + �3RYCSi,t−1 × UE\ni,t−1\n\n+ X\n�\n\ni,t−1\n� + �\n\ni,t\n\n8 In the following, we use the terms “insurrection” and “conflict” interchangeably as our (empirical) con-\nflict measure closely resembles what we modeled as “insurrections” in the theoretical section.\n\n74 Public Choice (2018) 175:63-93\n\nopportunities that matters.

We code the onset of a new insurrection only if there \nis no ongoing conflict in the current or previous year, and we exclude from our analysis all \ncountry-years of ongoing conflicts (Collier and Hoeffler 2004; McGrath 2015). We also \ncontrol for time dependence as suggested by Carter and Signorino (2010) and include the \nnumber of years elapsed since the last insurrection onset, as well as its squared and cubic \nterms ( t, t2, t3 ) in our regression.\n\nRegarding our main explanatory variable of interest, we calculate the RYCS as the ratio \nof the male youth cohort (aged 15–24 years) relative to the total economically active popu-\nlation (ages 15–69). A thus-defined youth-bulge ratio reflects the degree of competition \nover resources and working opportunities that the members of the youth cohort face when \nentering the labor market.9 Moreover, we focus on the share of young men among the work-\ning population, assuming that the relative abundance of men (rather than women) is the \nkey factor that leads to violent conflict (Moller 1968). In fact, Mesquida and Wiener (1999) \nshows that (young) men historically have been the main recruits for fomenting social unrest \nand rebellions, while in many traditional societies, women are not encouraged to partici-\npate in demonstrations and public protests. Yet, as shown in the robustness section, our \nresults are not sensitive to alternative definitions of the youth cohort. Demographic data are \ntaken from the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP, see United Nations 2015).\n\nOur theoretical model implies that a binding labor-market restriction producing invol-\nuntary unemployment interacts with the youth-bulge ratio, irrespective whether this \nrestriction is associated with economic shocks or inefficient regulation. We therefore rely \non changes in unemployment as our preferred measure of such a labor-market constraint. \nMore precisely, we include annual changes in the country-level unemployment rate, which \nis defined by the International Labor Organization as the share of the labor force without \nwork but available for and seeking employment. Those data are obtained from the World \nDevelopment Indicators (World Bank 2016). Since internationally comparable employ-\nment data are available for a large number of countries only from 1991 onward, our sample \nis restricted to the time period after the end of the Cold War.\n\nOne might prefer measuring institutional restrictions in terms of formal and informal \nentry barriers. However, data on these measures rarely are available on a broad cross-coun-\ntry time-series basis and, even if so, often omit conflict-prone countries. Nonetheless, we \nstill aim to capture the institutional dimension of labor-market restrictions more directly, \nso we also analyze the effect of the youth bulge when it interacts with two indices repre-\nsenting the regulatory qualities of labor-market institutions. Such indices are provided by \nthe Heritage Foundation (2016) as well as the Fraser Institute (Gwartney et al. 2016). Yet, \nowing to data limitations, the results based on these institutional variables reflect at most \ntentative support for the cross-country heterogeneity of the youth-conflict nexus. We, nev-\nertheless, are confident that it is safe to rely on unemployment data as our preferred proxy \nfor the labor-market restriction, in part because recent studies also have relied on that proxy \nin cross-country analyses of political conflict (Berman et  al. 2011; Campante and Chor \n2012). Moreover, Korenman and Neumark (1997) found evidence that less flexible labor-\nmarket institutions lead to larger changes in unemployment when the youth cohort size \nvaries through time.\n\n9 We refrain from relating the youth cohort size to the total population as such a measure might seriously \nunderestimate the extent of a youth bulge in the presence of continued high fertility rates (Urdal 2004, \n2006).\n\n\n\n76 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nYet, anticipation of future conflicts might affect current investment behavior (and thus \nlabor-market outcomes) as well as migration decisions (and thus the population’s age struc-\nture). Moreover, unobserved time-varying factors might influence both the conflict poten-\ntial of a society as well as demographic and economic characteristics (Blattman and Miguel \n2010). To account for these potential sources of reverse causality and joint identification, \nwe exploit an alternative source of variation in the demographic structure of a country that \nis more robust to those concerns. More precisely, we use the relative size of the youth \ncohort at the time when its members were born (i.e., in t-15 to t-24), and label that variable \nRYCS (at birth).10 The current size of the youth cohort might be influenced by the migra-\ntion decisions of individuals, which might be related to a country’s conflict history, or by \nbattle-related deaths that disproportionately reduce the size of that cohort relative to oth-\ners. Yet, we can plausibly assume that these concerns do not apply to the size of the youth \ncohort at birth years. Controlling for time and country fixed effects ensures that the results \nare not driven by unobserved factors.11\n\nSince we standardize our measure of relative youth cohort sizes, the interaction coef-\nficient �3 from Eq. (10) gives the differential effect of a rise in unemployment in countries \nwith an above-average youth bulge. While the main effect of unemployment clearly can be \nendogenous to conflict, our focus is on the heterogeneous treatment effect of labor-market \nshocks (in terms of rising unemployment) in different demographic settings. Nizalova and \nMurtazashvili (2016) show that interacting an arguably exogenous variable (RYCS at birth) \nwith a potentially endogenous variable (unemployment) can be interpreted as exogenous \nwhen controlling for the main effect of the endogenous variable.12 Thus, the differential \neffect of a rise in unemployment in countries with larger youth bulges is unlikely to flow \nthrough channels other than the labor-market constraints imposed on the youth cohort in \nthese countries. Our identification strategy closely follows recent studies on the effects of \naid on civil conflicts (Nunn and Qian 2014) and on economic growth (Dreher et al. 2015).\n\nFinally, we include a number of baseline controls that could introduce omitted variable \nbias. We include overall population size and the growth of the urban population (both taken \nfrom UNWPP) because a positive coefficient on the youth-bulge ratio might simply reflect \noverall population pressures, which in turn may be most critical in urban centers. Similarly, \na country’s demographic transition is likely to be correlated with its economic develop-\nment, which also influences the risk of conflict (Bloom and Williamson 1998). For this \nreason, we include gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (p.c.) in levels and its growth \nrate obtained from the Penn World Table Version 7.1 (Heston et al. 2012). In addition, we \ncontrol for the degree of political instability of a country, defined as a three-point or larger \nchange in the combined Polity2 score over the previous 3 years (Marshall et al. 2016), fol-\nlowing Fearon and Laitin (2003). Finally, we also account for potential contagion effects \nand the regional dimension of many conflicts by counting the total number of neighboring \ncountries that experience insurrection activities in a given year.\n\n10 Technically, we use the size of the cohort of the 0-to-9-year-old males at time t-15 [which becomes the \nyouth cohort (aged 15–24) in t]. In the denominator, we include the size of the population aged zero to 54 in \nt-15 [which becomes the total working population (aged 15–69) in t].\n11 Similar approaches are applied in studies of the relationship between youth cohorts and labor-market \noutcomes (Korenman and Neumark 1997) and in the literature on demography and economic growth (see, \nfor example, Bloom and Williamson 1998).\n12 See Angrist and Krueger (1999) for a technical discussion of this condition.\n\n\n\n77Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\nRegarding our estimation strategy, we apply fixed-effects least-squares (FELS) techniques \nthat allow for flexible specifications, such as the inclusion of interaction terms (Bazzi and \nBlattman 2014; Nunn and Qian 2014). Even though logit or probit techniques more ade-\nquately capture the non-linear functional form when the dependent variable is dichotomous, \nthe computation and interpretation of interaction effects, which is central to our analysis, is \nnot straightforward in these models. In particular, Ai and Norton (2003) show that the inter-\naction effects might have different signs and magnitudes for each observation in logistic \nregressions. For this reason, we estimate a linear probability model (LPM). Angrist and Pis-\nchke (2008) argue that the LPM often performs well with limited dependent variables. As \nshown below, our results are robust to non-linear estimation techniques as well.\n\nOur baseline sample is a panel of 135 non-OECD countries for the years 1992–2012. It \nincludes 82 insurrection onsets according to the above-specified criteria. Summary statis-\ntics for the baseline sample are shown in Table 1.13\n\n4.2  Baseline results\n\nIn columns (1) and (2) of Table 2, we present the results of a simple cross-sectional ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) estimation that includes only our variables of main interest [i.e., \nRYCS (at birth), unemployment changes and the interaction term], controlling for year, \nregion and region-year fixed effects. We find a positive and significant correlation between \nyouth bulges and the probability of a conflict onset, replicating the standard result from \nthe literature (Urdal 2006; Collier et al. 2009). However, the youth-bulge effect does not \nunconditionally impact on the risk of an insurrection onset, but instead interacts with the \nsurrounding labor-market conditions. The positive sign of the interaction coefficient in \ncolumn (2) indicates that the effect of a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment \non the probability of an insurrection onset is larger in countries with above-average youth \nbulges than in countries with an average youth-bulge ratio.\n\nSince there might be unobserved country characteristics, we include country fixed effects \nin column (3) of Table 2. While the youth-bulge coefficient is no longer significant, the inter-\naction between RYCS (at birth) and unemployment remains statistically significant through-\nout the analysis. Our preferred model specification is reported in column (4) where we add \nour baseline control variables. The coefficient of overall population size is significant and \nnegative, suggesting that for a given age structure, larger populations are not per se more con-\nflict-prone. That finding is supported by the positive estimate of the urban population growth \nrate. While economic development and growth have been shown to be robust predictors of \ncivil conflicts in cross-sectional studies (Fearon and Laitin 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004), \nwe do not find those variables to have significant effects in our panel estimations. Yet, that \nresult is in line with recent evidence that accounts for country effects and time persistence \n(Bazzi and Blattman 2014). Also, political instability is not significantly associated with \ninsurrection onsets in our sample. The negative coefficient of the total number on neighbors \nat war might indicate that countries in conflict-prone regions simply are more likely to be \ninvolved in a conflict as well (with the conflict years dropping out of the sample).14\n\n13 We provide an online appendix that contains additional information on the definitions and sources of all \nvariables included in our analysis.\n14 One concern with the included controls is that they might be endogenous to insurrections and tend to be \ncorrelated with each other (Burke et al. 2014). Therefore, we treat these controls with caution and also pre-\nsent results without them. Nevertheless, our results do not depend on the chosen number and definition of \nthe control variables. Additional regression results are available from the authors.\n\n\n\n78 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nIn quantitative terms, the results in column (4) of Table 2 suggest that the effect of a \none-percentage-point increase in unemployment on the risk of an insurrection onset is \n0.616 percentage points higher in a country with a male youth-bulge ratio of 18% (cor-\nresponding to the 75th percentile of the sample distribution) than in a country with a male \nyouth-bulge ratio of 15% (corresponding to the sample mean).15 In other words, relative \nto the average probability of an insurrection onset, which is 3.5%, a one-percentage-point \nincrease in unemployment raises the risk of a conflict onset by roughly 21% when going \nfrom a country with an average youth bulge of 15%, like Ecuador in 2003 or Botswana in \n2010, to a country with a youth bulge of 18%, like Somalia in 2005 or Syria in 2006.\n\nWe are also interested in the marginal effect of the youth-bulge ratio, which depends on \nthe labor-market conditions in the economy. We therefore calculate the marginal effect of \nRYCS (at birth) over the range of unemployment changes that we observe in our sample \nand show the result in Fig. 3. The figure shows that the marginal effect of the relative youth \ncohort size increases with rising unemployment and becomes significant for changes in \nunemployment of approximately 4.8 percentage points and more.\n\nIn column (5) of Table 2, we include the averaged values of the control variables from \ncolumn (4) for the years t-15 to t-24 to account for the fact that these covariates might be \ncorrelated with the relative youth cohort size at birth years and have a persistent impact \non the conflict risk of a country (coefficients not shown). The coefficient of the interaction \neffect remains positive and significant, while the coefficients of most of the additional con-\ntrols are not significant. Finally, in column (6) and (7), we show that our baseline results \nare robust when we include the current youth-bulge ratio instead of RYCS (at birth). The \nestimates of the interaction term are similar in magnitude to our baseline estimates, sug-\ngesting that fluctuations in cohort sizes over time are not a major concern in our analysis \nand that RYCS (at birth) is in fact a valid proxy for the current RYCS. Yet, we cannot ulti-\nmately rule out that current variations in youth cohorts are caused by the propensity of \n\nTable 1  Summary statistics\n\nRYCS relative youth cohort size; GDP p.c. gross domestic product per capita\n\nVariable Observations Mean SD Min.

Thus, the overall effect of a one-unit increase in UE (= unemployment changes) at \nRYCS (at birth) = 0.149 is simply 𝛾\n\n2\n . For a country with RYCS (at birth) = 0.177, the standardized \n\nvalue is 0.848. The overall effect of a one-unit increase in UE at RYCS (at birth) = 0.177 is therefore \n𝛾\n2\n+ 𝛾\n\n3\n∗ 0.848 . The differential effect of a one-unit increase in UE is the difference in both effects, or \n\n𝛾\n3\n∗ 0.848 = 0.00727 ∗ 0.848 = 0.00616 (i.e., 0.616 percentage points).\n\n\n\n79Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\nconflict onsets. Therefore, the inclusion of the more robust youth-bulge measure appears \njustified on these conceptual grounds. Importantly, the differential effect of an increase in \nunemployment on the likelihood of an insurrection onset in countries with above-average \nyouth bulges (at birth years) is unlikely to arise through channels other than adverse labor-\nmarket conditions. Thus, the interaction effect indeed captures the moderating role of \nlabor-market restrictions on the demography-conflict nexus.\n\n4.3  Alternative labor‑market indicators and heterogeneous effects\n\nThe main implication of our theoretical model states that whenever a binding labor-market \nrestriction exists in the sense of unemployment, individuals have an incentive to shift labor \nsupply from the official labor market to insurrection activities, and this is particularly the \ncase for young individuals. While the underlying cause of an increase in unemployment \ncould be both economic shocks along with inefficient labor-market institutions, this predic-\ntion does not depend on the source of the labor-market restriction. Still, from a policy per-\nspective, we are more interested in the effect that inefficient regulatory rules have on young \nindividuals’ access to the regular labor market and the related potential for political griev-\nances to erupt. To test the effect of institutional constraints on the youth-conflict nexus, \nwe enter two indicators of the regulatory quality of labor-market institutions in our model \nin Table 3. Data are drawn from the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom \nand the Economic Freedom of the World Index provided by the Fraser Institute (Gwart-\nney et  al. 2016). Both indices reflect the legal framework of a country’s labor market, \nwith higher values indicating more flexible laws and fewer regulatory constraints, such as \n\n-0\n.0\n\n5\n0\n\n0.\n05\n\n0.\n1\n\n0.\n15\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.\n25\n\n0.\n3\n\nM\nar\n\ngi\nna\n\nl e\nffe\n\nct\n o\n\nf R\nY\n\nC\nS\n\n (a\nt b\n\nirt\nh)\n\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nChanges in unemployment (percentage points)\n\nFig. 3  Marginal effects of RYCS (at birth) as unemployment changes.

To that end, we construct a time-invariant dummy that takes the value one if the \naverage country score is greater than the median among countries in the sample.17 Thus, \nthe coefficient of RYCS (at birth) in columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 can be interpreted as \nthe effect of an increase in the youth-bulge ratio in countries with below-median qualities \nof labor regulations, while the sum of this coefficient and the interaction effect indicates \nthe youth-bulge effect in countries with above-median institutional quality. In line with \nour baseline results, we find a positive and significant correlation of the youth-bulge ratio \nand the likelihood of a conflict onset for countries with below-median values of regula-\ntory quality for both indicators. In contrast, the effect is substantially smaller in countries \nwith above-median institutional quality, as indicated by the negative and significant point \nestimate of the interaction term. In fact, the sum of both coefficients is close to zero and \nnot statistically significant in both regressions. The results show that, apart from cyclical \nchanges in unemployment, institutional bottlenecks imposed on the youth indeed aggravate \nthe conflict potential inherent in the demographic phenomenon of a youth bulge.\n\nThe results presented so far might hide substantial heterogeneity with regard to the \nconflict potential of large youth cohorts in different institutional settings. The interplay \nof demographic pressures and labor-market conditions might be moderated by additional \nfactors that shape the overall institutional context and therefore the income opportunities \nof different population cohorts. One important factor is the political system. In autocratic \nregimes, institutionalized channels for expressing political discontent, such as in elections, \ndo not exist, and even when they do, they do not function as a means of policy change \n(Boix and Svolik 2013). For this reason, a market for insurrection activities is more likely \nto arise in those systems (Shadmehr and Haschke 2016). In contrast, youth bulges are less \nof a threat to state authorities in democracies that provide mechanisms other than repres-\nsion, such as political participation and non-violent civil resistance, to respond to demo-\ngraphic pressures (Stephan and Chenoweth 2008; Nordås and Davenport 2013). Also, \npolitical outcomes in democracies tend to be more distributive, which might facilitate the \nprovision of social benefits to economically disadvantaged groups.\n\nTo investigate whether the interaction of youth bulges and unemployment depends on \nthe political system, we include a three-way interaction effect of RYCS (at birth), unem-\nployment and a democracy dummy in our model.18 We rely on the dichotomous regime \nclassification of Cheibub et al.  (2010), who define a democratic system according to the \n\n16 One could question the extent to which the absence of regulatory constraints actually reflects functioning \nlabor markets. While this might be true for many (though not all) developed countries, in less developed \ncountries the absence of labor regulations could simply reflect the failure of the state to establish a regula-\ntory framework needed for functioning markets in the first place. That is one more reason why we refrain \nfrom using these indices as our main labor-market indicators.\n17 Since the indicator variable does not vary over time and the relative youth cohort size exhibits only lit-\ntle within-country variation, we refrain from including country fixed effects in our model, but instead enter \nregional and region-year fixed effects.\n18 In models (3)–(6) of Table 3, we separately include dummy variables for the political system, levels of \neducation and resource rents. For ease of exposition, we summarize the coefficients on the main effects of \nthese variables in one line, and we do the same for the interaction with RYCS (at birth) and the three-way \ninteraction effect, using as a placeholder the term “indicator variable”.\n\n\n\n85Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\npresence of free and contested elections.19 The positive interaction effect of RYCS (at birth) \nand unemployment in column (3) of Table 3 indicates that higher unemployment aggra-\nvates the conflict potential of a youth bulge in autocratic countries (i.e., when democracy \n= 0). In democracies, this effect is substantially smaller, as indicated by the negative three-\nway interaction effect.20 Figure 4 shows the marginal effects of RYCS (at birth) in the two \ndifferent political regimes. In democratic countries, the marginal effect is not statistically \ndistinguishable from zero and does not depend on changes in labor-market conditions. In \ncontrast, in autocracies the marginal effect of the youth-bulge ratio increases significantly \nwith rising unemployment and is much more pronounced than our baseline effect, where \nwe did not differentiate between political systems. The results thus support the idea that \nautocracies impose institutional constraints on the youth that are very different from those \nimposed in democratic systems.\n\nAnother mediating factor that has been emphasized in the relationship between youth \nbulges and conflict is education. In general, it is argued that higher levels of education \nraise income opportunities for young people (Barakat and Urdal 2009). However, rapid \nexpansions in access to higher education potentially could produce a large group of highly \neducated young people that the labor market is unable to absorb, resulting in worse income \nprospects for graduates (Urdal 2006; Campante and Chor 2012). To test the role of educa-\ntion, we construct two dummy variables that indicate whether average years of schooling \n\n19 The results are qualitatively similar if we use the PolityIV definition and define as democratic all coun-\ntry-years with a Polity2 score of more than five.\n20 The partial effects of an increase in RYCS for a given value of UE in autocracies ver-\nsus democracies are computed as follows. In autocracies (i.e., when democracy = 0), the \neffect of RYCS is given by 0.0647 + 0.0224 × UE . When democracy = 1, the effect of RYCS is \n0.0647 − 0.0660 + (0.0224 − 0.0213) × UE = − 0.0013 + 0.0011 × UE , which clearly is smaller than the \neffect in autocracies for any UE > 0.\n\n0\n-0\n\n.2\n0.\n\n2\n0.\n\n4\n0.\n\n6\n0.\n\n8\nM\n\nar\ngi\n\nna\nl e\n\nffe\nct\n\n o\nf R\n\nY\nC\n\nS\n (a\n\nt b\nirt\n\nh)\n\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nChanges in unemployment (percentage points)\n\nAutocracy Democracy\n\nFig. 4  Marginal effects of RYCS (at birth) in democratic and autocratic countries.

The dotted lines indicate the 90% confidence interval\n\n\n\n86 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nand average years of tertiary schooling are above the sample median.21 The results in col-\numn (4) and (5) of Table 3 suggest that in countries with above-average years of schooling, \nthe conflict potential of a youth bulge in the presence of adverse labor-market conditions \nis substantially lower than in countries with below-average years of schooling, as indicated \nby the negative and significant three-way interaction effect. In contrast, higher levels of ter-\ntiary schooling do not appear to have a significant effect on the conflict potential of a youth \nbulge, at least in our sample.\n\nFinally, we test the moderating role of rents from natural resources. The coefficients in \ncolumn (6) of Table 3 indicate that in countries with large shares of resource rents in GDP \n(more than 30%), the conflict potential of a youth bulge is significantly less than in coun-\ntries with fewer rents, even in the presence of rising unemployment. This result points to an \ninterpretation in line with the argument that governments can buy off potential youth oppo-\nsition in  situations where income opportunities in the economy are declining if govern-\nments exert sufficient control over the production and trading channels of natural resources.\n\n4.4  Further robustness tests\n\nWe apply a series of further robustness tests to our baseline specification from model (4) \nin Table  2. In column (7) of Table  3, we model the dynamics of insurrection onsets by \nentering lagged values of the dependent variable.22 The results are qualitatively unchanged \nfrom our baseline estimates, in particular with respect to the sign and magnitude of the \ninteraction effect. The negative sign on the lagged dependent variable is intuitive as we \ninclude insurrection onsets that separate times of peace from those of conflict. However, \nemploying the fixed-effects estimator in dynamic panel data models might result in the so-\ncalled Nickell bias (Nickell 1981). Therefore, we use two alternative estimation techniques \nto assess the reliability of our fixed-effects estimates. In column (8) of Table 3, we employ \nthe bias-corrected least-squares dummy variable (LSDVC) estimator proposed by Kiviet \n(1995) and extended to unbalanced panels by Bruno (2005). In addition, we also report the \nresults of the Arellano-Bond generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimator (Arellano \nand Bond 1991).23 The estimation results are similar in size and significance to the within \nestimates. The GMM estimates further support the reliability of our results by including \ninternal instruments for potentially endogenous variables. The p value of Hansen’s J test of \njoint exogeneity suggests that the instruments are valid.\n\n22 Excluding all observations of ongoing conflicts produces a somewhat artificial correlation between cur-\nrent and lagged values of the dependent variable. Therefore, in the dynamic specifications, the dependent \nvariable is coded one for all conflict onsets, while country-years of ongoing conflicts are coded zero, fol-\nlowing the coding procedure of Fearon and Laitin (2003). We call this variable “any conflict onset”. In the \nonline appendix, we provide a list of included cases for all conflict definitions.\n23 We employ the first-difference GMM estimator instead of the system GMM estimator because it involves \nfewer internal instruments. As instruments, we use lagged levels of the dependent variable, unemployment \n(changes) and their interaction with the youth bulge, assuming exogeneity for RYCS (at birth). The results \ndo not change when entering internal instruments for this variable as well.\n\n21 The construction of the binary variables is similar to the institutional indicators in column (1) and (2) of \nTable 3. The only difference is that we do not construct time-invariant country averages, but use the annual \nobservations to capture expansions in education over time. We use total years of schooling as well as years \nof tertiary schooling from the dataset of Barro and Lee (2013). To control for endogeneity concerns and \nsince the data are available only for 5-year periods, we lag the variable by 5 years following Campante and \nChor (2012).\n\n\n\n87Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93 \n\n1 3\n\nWe also account for the fact that our dependent variable is a dichotomous conflict indi-\ncator by applying non-linear estimation techniques. Since the coefficient of the interac-\ntion effect cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way in logit regressions (Ai and Norton \n2003), we show average marginal effects (AMEs) for our baseline model in column (10) of \nTable 3. The positive and significant AMEs support our results from the linear specifica-\ntion. For a given labor-market situation, larger youth-bulge ratios are, on average, associ-\nated with a higher probability of a violent conflict onset.24\n\nOverall, the empirical findings support our theoretical expectation that it is not the \ndemographic structure on its own that raises the incidence of insurrections but whether \nlarge youth cohorts are confronted with a decline in employment prospects in the official \nlabor market. Whereas the youth bulge is significant in some, but not all regressions, we \nfind a significant and robust interaction effect of the youth bulge and tighter labor-market \nconstraints on the likelihood of a violent conflict onset. In other words, negative labor-mar-\nket shocks seem to be most harmful to the working prospects of young men, inducing them \nto reallocate time away from the official labor market and toward insurrections.\n\n5  Conclusions\n\nThis paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of how the interplay of a youth \nbulge and labor-market restrictions influences the risk of insurrection activities. We have \ndeveloped a theoretical model of insurrection markets and integrated the relative youth \ncohort size as a measure of the youth bulge. Moreover, we have tested the empirical \nimplications of our theory on a sample of 135 countries in the post-Cold War period. Our \nempirical model confirms the hypothesized causality between, on the one hand, a binding \nlabor-market constraint in interaction with a youth bulge, and, on the other hand, the prob-\nability of an insurrection onset at the aggregate country level.\n\nOur central finding implies that whether or not a youth bulge actually translates into \noutbreaks of political violence at an aggregate scale depends on the surrounding politico-\neconomic institutions. In brief, labor-market institutions that exhibit a closed-shop charac-\nter promote the supply of insurrection activists who may easily be hired by revolutionary \nentrepreneurs. In contrast, open-access labor-market institutions offering attractive oppor-\ntunities for young people tend to reduce such a potential.\n\nMeasuring labor-market restrictions by changes in unemployment, we find strong and \nrobust evidence for the moderating role of labor-market conditions on the conflict potential of \na youth bulge. We provide a measure of youth bulges that is robust to reverse causality running \nfrom contemporaneous conflicts to demographic structures, and we show that the differential \neffect of tighter labor-market constraints in countries with large youth bulges is unlikely to \narise through channels other than the institutional bottlenecks they impose on the youth.\n\nOur approach aims to deepen our understanding of the relationship between demogra-\nphy, access to career opportunities, and conflicts. In that regard, the demographic structure \nof the contemporary Arab world may turn out to be much more relevant for explaining the \nviolent contemporary conflicts than the religious cleavages that appear on the surface. Our \nmodel is in line with such an explanation, and it suggests that the structural causes of civil \nconflict need to be disentangled more thoroughly.\n\n24 In the online appendix we provide additional robustness tests to our baseline model. In particular, we \nshow that our results are robust to alternative definitions of the dependent variable and the youth cohort, as \nwell as to different time structures and to the inclusion of additional demographic controls.\n\n\n\n88 Public Choice (2018) 175:63–93\n\n1 3\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Roger Congleton and Randall Holcombe for helpful discussions \nat the 2016 Meeting of the Public Choice Society, as well as to the anonymous referees and the editor in \ncharge of our submission, William Shughart II, for unusually constructive comments.
